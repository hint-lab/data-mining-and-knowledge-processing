2,Great CD,"My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing ""Who was that singing ?"""
2,Loved it then and now.,I saw this film when it first came out in the early 70's with my wife in connecticut. We didn't know what we were getting into but this movie was great fun with non-stop good music and featured Richard Pryor and other great black performers.
1,What have they tried to the original movie Cinderella??,"HiI wanted to add my two cents, here. I saw this movie when it first came on tv in the mid 90's. I don't remember it that well, but remember being stunned and horrified of such a multi-cultural cast. I agree with the reviewer who pointed out how odd it was and awkward it would have been to try to explain to your kids why the king is asian and his parents are both different races. I hadn't thought about that. And Brandy as Cinderella?? Please. I did like some of Whitney's singing, but competely disagreed with all the different races in the movie.. and a BLACK step-sister?? Geez. And no, i am not racist. I just thought it was very odd and very wrong to have different races making up families in the movie. TOO PC for me. YOu just can't improve on the original classic."
1,"Not Very Stiff, It Does Bend",Well I bought this fork and 2 Amco stainless spoons because another reviewer said you cannot bend it. I used the fork to pick up a 2 pound london broil and it bent! I used the spoon to stir 3 pounds of mashed potatoes and it too bent. I had to straighten them out by hand but they are not in the same shape as they were when new. I am disappointed as I need a good sturdy fork.
1,Cheap. Save your money,The handle on the bowl broke off. I called KA they told me I bought it in August (I didn't I bought it in nov for a Christmas gift). KA argued with me! After I produced a receipt they told me they'd replace the crappy plastic bowl. How can this be the same Manu of the mixer you can have for 20 years??
2,Best dog gate,"I recently moved so needed new dog gates. I had this type in the other house and liked it very much... and so did the buyers, so i had to leave them! Now I have them in this new house also; these are the best. They look great with any decor and are very serviceable, easy to open."
1,Loud - Don't get unless you plan on wearing ear plugs,"This pump works, but is loud enough to wake up the entire house and possibly neighbors.If you need quick inflation this is for you; otherwise get something that is a bit slower and much quieter."
1,"A pillow, not a backpack","I bought this for my preschooler, thinking that it would be a good backpack for him to take his supplies to class.Unfortunately, this product is more like a Lightning McQueen pillow with shoulder straps than something useful for carrying anything. The pocket for it is about 4 inches by five inches and has no depth at all --- think of a flat zippered money pouch.The shoulder straps are flat 1 inch pieces of nylon webbing and do not appear to be very sturdily attached.This would have been a fine product if the pocket was bigger and not so much stuffing put in it.As it is, I cannot recommend it as a backpack."
1,Similar unit RF 275,"My experience with the older model may help. It uses std 9 volt batteries Lower cost!It has been good for 3 years+ but recently started flashing after new battery insertedManual says remove battery & hold correction level set button ""until the light goes out"" There was no light so held for a few sceonds only -- no better . Petsafe tech said $40 for replacement receiver . I tried a new approach I held the correction set button for about 30 seconds even tho the light was out all the time . Installed new battery & everything works again! Typical battery life has been 6 months+ This model is still available & is a better option I think."
2,Energetic WWII film,"This story is about a French railroad's head switch-man (played by Burt Lancaster) whose actions foil the Germans as they retreat from the advancing allied army with a train load of France's entire treasure of masterpiece paintings. With the help of the French underground, the art treasure travels in circles, and the bewildered Germans are none the wiser.""The Train"" is Burt Lancaster at his very best; fast moving, quick to act."
2,A different anime,"Mushi-shi is not your action-type anime; no giant robots or sword-wielding ninja or vampires. But I find myself returning to Mushi-shi more than I do the other anime series I own. So many series get placed on the shelf and not visited again except for one or two key episodes once I've watched it through to the end and know how everything turns out. But I return to each episode of Mushi-shi again and again, and find something new to appreciate in it each time. I'm not waiting anxiously for the next volume so I find out who lives/dies or how my favorite character fares: I'm anxiously waiting because this is a series that I enjoy every moment of every episode and enjoy it just as much the fifth time I view it as the first."
1,A Tremendous Disappointment,"I was so excited to get this CD. I imagined it would be somewhat different but equally beautiful as the Belle and Sebastian albums. When I listened to it, I really wanted to like it. However, I found it to be so amateurishly bad, as if Isobel Cambell couldn't write a decent song if her life depended on it. It is now clear to me that the two Stuarts are the real artists in this band. If Isobel wrote ""Is It Wicked Not To Care"" and ""The Gate,"" I commend her, as those are excellent songs. However, on the Gentle Waves CD she doesn't seem to have a clue how to write a melody. As a final note, I think her lyrics are cheesy."
2,Good power and not too quiet.,"This fan is doing an excellent job of pulling in the cooler morning air into my house down here in hot Florida.It has much more power than the similarly priced and smaller fans that I have.Also, the adverising makes the claim that it's whisper quiet; Fortunately, that's not accurate. There is a strong smooth white noise that drowns out most of the extraneous and annoying noise in the house and outside.Honeywell used to make fans with this much power that were smaller and could be tilted and that costs around $15.00. Those were 5 star fans. The Lasko 3733 is a solid 4 star fan."
2,THE BEST,"It has taken me forever to find the perfect foundation for my senstive skin. I have rosesea, and you would not know it when I have my powder on. It stays put. It does not come off on your hand when you rub your face. Stays put during sweaty humid summer days. You never get the caked on feeling that other faoundations give. Easy to match to skin tone. GREAT PRODUCT!!"
1,its fiction/faction,"This account is a detailed first person, ground level view of a sniper on the eastern front. It reads EXACTLY like a Sven Hassel. This is achieved by the author making up the stories. He has, at most, met the sniper, Wacker, and got some brief outline stories of Wacker's actions. From these, he has written what he imagines it must have been like. He creates details and info that Wacker couldnt have known, and this pads the story out. So it is just as if Sven Hassel had written a story about wacker. God alone knows if theres ANY truth in it....maybe a few grains...Gripping, fast , trashy, hollywood war."
2,Excellent and have a question,"Review below, but have a question: Anyone use the SDHC 4gb with their S3?I enjoy the camera, don't like the lens cap, and had to get a little used to holding the camera, but overal it is wonderful.This camera replaced an Olympus 1.3mp and wow what a difference in quality to the 6mp.The movies were surprisingly clear and with stereo sound I was able to pick up the voices of people in the shot.This camera has more options then I'll ever need. The usuer manual is hard to read in the printed shady areas (old eyes I guess), so I've gone online to read it. Problem solved."
2,"Great Value but ""pricey""","I just received this saw blade package in the mail today. But over this past weekend I found the same blades at Lowe's for $10.00 cheaper. Between 32-34 dollars and no need to wait to have it shipped. All the reviews I've read say that there great blades I will see this weekend as I have many projects to get a start on while the weather is getting better. ""Mac"" from Southgate, Mi."
2,creative fun,I bought this to replace a pin art my daughter had that broke. This one is larger than her previous one and seems more durable. The pins are a little sharp. She likes it alot.
1,Pure Fiction,"Believing in this logical fallacy is an insult to my intelligence. This says alot about the mental capacity of the American people. We a need new independent investigation to determine exactly what happen on 9/11 and the dates leading to the ""Terrorist attacks"" and all those responsible, whether they are powerful or not need to be brought to justice."
1,Boring isn't the word for it!,"My 2 year-old daughter received this toy for her 2nd birthday. She was so excited about it and played with it for all of an hour. That was a month and a half ago and Lily hasn't been played with since. She really doesn't do much. She only sings two songs! Really, really boring toy."
1,Mars? Venus? Go Back Home!,"I feel like from different planet when I to read this book. English not hard, but little of book is to talk about space. No UFOs in the book, and I read to cover. Why is the point of this book, please to tell me. It not good for astronomer."
2,Go Walkabout,"I had a chance to look through this book recently at a friends house, and I was pretty impressed. It contains a bunch of useful maps, which from my experience are more than adequate to help you get where your going, or find a place to go if you don't know where you want to be. It also has page upon page of great information on all things walking in Australia. Well worth the price."
2,Really gets the poop off,"I've tried other unscented wipes that I bought from Amazon, but these really have worked the best. I don't think they're that rough on my baby's skin, but also because of their texture they really get the poop off, so I end up using fewer and have to wipe less. I highly recommend these.The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is that with this particular packaging you always get a plastic dispenser, which I end up throwing away because it's hard-to-recycle #5 plastic (how many can I keep?), and that's not great for the environment.As far as the cost factor goes, they are available for less on a per wipe basis at [...], but with Amazon you can get them delivered to your door, so that's a trade-off."
1,Not sure why it got such a good rating,"Not sure why it got such a good rating. Acting was really bad, didn't finish watching the movie. Why did it get 4 starts?"
2,Good,Got this for my Body Rider Fan Bike (on amazon) which the seat is pretty awful and this helps quite a bit.
2,Great gift for someone serious about sound,I bought these as a Christmas gift for my son and they were a real hit. Very retro both in packaging and product. The sound is amazing!
2,The Wizard of Seattle by Kay Hooper,For a short story fiction book I thought it quite fun and a great little read. This book would be great for a cold rainey day to curl up with. I really enjoyed it!
2,Cliff Hanger Forever,"This was an excellent sci fi series with an outstanding plot and character development. It was innovative, not predictable and so much more then a bang bang shoot em up series of car races and crashes.This deserved a second and third season at least. I now watch series like these on Netflix and no longer watch regular cable TV at all because of the excessive 50/50 ratio of show time to ad time.That said, I do not like cliff hangers that will never be revisited. Like many TV shows, this can be best appreciated on DVD or Netflix. The break ups for so many extended ad times on cable TV makes this great show hard to follow and chopped when viewed on cable. If you don't like series ending with closure, this one is not for you."
1,Broke after two months. Beware!,"Remote worked straight out of the box. Programmed easily, I was happy.However after two months of usage, the remote broke. I changed the battery but to no avail. My other remote (a different brand) was still going strong."
2,Breathtaking,"This book is as good as the first two. The characters continue to develop, the war continues, everyone is in peril...By now I have an emotional stake in the characters and, as with the previous ones, I was turning the pages as fast as I could to learn the outcome of each new situation. The plot twists had me holding my breath, and I nearly cried in several places.As with book two, the book ends in a maddeningly frustrating cliff hanger, and book four isn't due out until the fall. ARRGG!!!!This series is truly epic, and it's extremely well written. I can't stand it that the next book isn't out yet."
2,Farce of Industry,"If there was ever a farce made of an entertainment industry, this comedy is the best example of.A funny sexy depicting of instantly occurring black deeds in a same block of flats is a mix of all genres cinematographic, where a homosexual hairdresser murdered hit-woman-nun, a mother of him.About a dozen of troops substantiate this black comedy with Buddhist monk and unprofessional Special Forces involved just to laugh at the end."
1,not worth reading,This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot is weak at best. The book is filled with long sections of useless information that has nothing to do with the story line. This is the author's first novel and hopefully his last. Definately stay away from this one.
1,Boo...,I bought these based on the few positive reviews... Bad decision. Crayola tub crayons are way better- our last set lasted us quite a long time- where as we just are using these in the bath for the first time tonite and they did all fall out of the holders and are essentially melting in the bathtub. Not worth the savings. I'll be buying another set of Crayola.Crayola Bathtub Crayons - Colors will vary
2,NRA Paper 100 yard Target,"Nice size paper target. If you use ""Shoot-N-C"" adhesive targets, they line up perfectly with the circles on the paper target.The packaging of the 100 targets was done using strapping materials. This caused ripping in about 10 of the targets 1/2"" where the strap was bound across them."
1,Another owner with a dead LCD,"Printer produces nice pics, but LCD went black after 6 months. Epsoc CS sent a replacement RX620 (newer unit). DOA. Nice quality control, guys. May want to look at an HP even though they don't have separate ink carts."
1,VAN DAMME'S WORST B MOVIE,Derailed is something like a bad TV action soap opera...THis movie is a shame.
2,good toaster,"This is the second one I bought, the last one lasted quite a long time. This one seems to do toast better than the last one. I love the space it saves being both a toaster and an oven. It's great!!"
1,Beware 83 min. VHS version with the yellow cover art!,"Black Sunday is a classic film that, as a film, rates at least four and a half stars. Unfortunately, one of the VHS versions being offered, the 83 min. version with the yellow cover art, is *neither* the new Image restoration, nor is it AIP's generally well-regarded version with the Les Baxter score.This 83 min. version (click on tech. details to see running time) with the yellow cover art is actually a *very* poor quality transfer from a very soft, scratchy, and splicy print, put out by a company called Video Entertainment Corp. It's essentially a censored, poor quality version of the Italian version--the worst of both worlds.If you're going to get Black Sunday on VHS, by all means opt for the widescreen VHS put out by Image, which has *red* cover art, and an 87 min. running time (again, click on tech. details to confirm that the version you are getting is the 87 min. version from Image)."
2,Story will stay with you,This was certainly not the book I expected but in someways it was better. Thinking it would be more about the prison I found instead a heartfelt story about a family who lived on the island and how the isolation affected everyone. A young girl watches her mother slowly lose sight of who she is. This is a story that will stay with you for a long time. I won this from LibraryThing Members Giveaway and I recommend this book.
1,Disappointing,"I haven't seen the movie Swordfish because I've heard it's not that great, but I have heard plenty from Paul Oakenfold. His mix CDs set the high mark for trance compilations, but this soundtrack is most definitely not his best work. These tracks sound contrived and completely out of context. Please save me from the extremely annoying Travolta dialog mixed in from the film. Stick to Paul's DJ mix compilations to avoid disappointment."
1,This is not a Chinese Holy Bible,This book is a story about FENG SHUI. It is not a Christian Holy Bible.
2,Slippers,I got these slippers for my daughters friend for christmas. She loved them. She wil be getting more in other colors!
2,White Chicks is an all-time favorite.,This movie is spectacular!!! The Wayans brothers are fantastic and the entire cast keep you laughing through the entire movie. This movie also has a great ending and message for all.
1,Not just a children's book!,"I'm appalled by some of the more literal and snotty reviews for this wonderful book, which is for all ages; I bought this for Paul, my same-sex partner, on Valentine's day several years ago. It's not about competitive love, it's about unconditional love. What appeals most is that the relationship between big nut brown hare and little nut brown hare is never defined, nor does it need to be.Paul, the love of my life, died last week, and I am reading this book aloud at his funeral.BTW somehow the 1 star above appearred & isn't my real opinion - it's 5 stars all the way."
2,Very helpful for those on the road...,"As a frequent traveller and someone interested in specific running goals, (as opposed to ""just going out for a jog"") the Forerunner 305 has been extremely helpful.My wife originally got me the Forerunner 405 BUT it was too small for my wrist. (The 305 has a larger, alternate wrist strap). My wife refers to the 305 as a ""laptop for the wrist"" but it is not heavy or cumbersome - the buttons are clearly marked and easy to use.The various training workouts are helpful and easy to program (pace / distance / time / interval workouts...). I have had no problems with the GPS - just remember to turn the unit on when you are outside and ready to run (to ensure GPS reception). Aural alerts are helpful and there are enough functions to check out that can keep you occupied on long runs.I have not explored all of the training or navigation functions on the 305 but I would venture to say that there are more than the average runner would need to use."
1,dont like,not fun and its hard thank god i rented it cause this game [stinks] its not worth [junk] rent it and find out ur self
2,For fans of Leverage,"It's a fun little movie. Fans of Leverage will like it, it's very similar in style. The 'beats' or timing, the quirky yet totally capable characters, and even the music are very Leverage-esq or I should say Leverage is very Foolproof-esq as the movie came out first. In fact I even hunted about on IMDB to see if it was the same writer or director and was surprised when it wasn't. All in all it's a good pizza night flick for those who like caper films or those jonesing for the second half of the Leverage season (Why TNT?! Why must you torture us?!?!)"
1,Disappointment,"My disappointment came because I was expecting a whimsical, humorous novel around the idea of Mary coming to visit. Instead, the ""novel"" was a thinly veiled attempt to describe lots of Mary's apparitions, something I could have researched on my own, had I been so inclined. I am a faithful Catholic with a devotion to Mary, so my disappointment was strictly based on unfulfilled expectations. The author's style became tedious after awhile as well. The narrator is an author who talks about her own weaknesses, such as too many distracting specifics, and that was precisely what the author did in this book. Toward the end, she became highly philosophical and abstract, just adding to my disappointment for anticipating a whimsical story."
2,sent to family member and they said it was excellent.,Sent this to a family member and she said it was excellent. Wouldrecommend this to everyone to read.
1,Alas! A Bore,"I am a devoted, loyal fan of Edith Layton. I have enjoyed many of her novels, but I have to agree with the previous readers, this novel was not worth my money. The hero was ""not to die for"" but instead stilted and hypocritical. The majority of the book was wasted on describing his courtship with the wrong woman! He continually fought his attraction to the heroine, causing us readers to lose all patience with him. The lovers did not come together until the book was almost at its conclusion. There was no sexual tension, no romance no true character development or evolvement. All in all, I would like my money back! Edith Layton is a wonderful writer, please do not judge her by this novel, rather, read her earlier books. The ""C"" novels are excellent!"
2,Don't even hesitate,"If you like Gershwin and you want to know what he wanted these pieces to sound like...go no further than this recording. Mitch Miller, David Golub and the London Symphony give, what I believe, is the definitive recording of these works. Miller performed with Gershwin and ""this"" Mitch Miller is a long way from the Mitch Miller of ""pop"" years ago. Miller was a classical oboe/English horn virtuoso and his classic musical talent is obvious here. David Golub is a wonder. What more can I say? The rest is silence............"
1,still waiting to return,"i am still waiting to return this item becase their computer system is unable to print me a returns note, which was not enclosed with the product, and the link to print myself bought from amazon does not work eitherthe product is very good just too big for my daughter"
2,One of the most outstanding films I have ever seen.,Although I have not seen this movie since the 1980's I see it's influence everywhere. A movie that should be seen by everyone! But this could be hard when you can't find it to either buy or rent. Bring it back!
1,DON'T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT,"ITS NOISY!!!!. OVEN MUST BE SECURED BEFORE YOU OPEN THE TRAY DOOR, IF NOT SECURED THE OVEN ENDS UP IN YOUR LAP. DOES NOT COOK IN ALLOTTED TIMES SPECIFIED IN COOKING DIRECTIONS. IF WORKING WITH BREAD CRUMB ITEMS, WHEN YOU OPEN TRAY DOOR YOUR COUNTER GETS MESSY WITH CRUMBS. WHEN COOKING STEAKS, BURGERS, ANYTHING THAT HAS A LOT OF FAT DRIPPINGS, SPLATTERS WILL OCCUR AND THE OVEN IS A PAIN TO CLEAN. AGAIN, WHEN YOU OPEN TRAY DOOR DRIPPINGS WILL GET ALL OVER COUNTER. IF YOU WANT THIS OVEN FOR PIZZA YOU WLL FIND THAT IT DOES NOT CRISP IN SETTING TIME. THE INFOCOMMERCIAL IS A LOT OF BULL. I HAD TO GIVE THIS PRODUCT A 1 STAR TO GET THIS REVIEW POSTED."
2,awsome!!!,iT WAS A REALLY GOOD BOOK!!! It took my breath away with the ending!!! it had a bunch of good characters in the book!!!
2,good but not exactly what I thought,It wasn't the translation I was hoping for ( mistake on my part) but I found it to be good enough for my purposes.
1,So this must be what it's like to have the IQ of a goldfish.,Gave this movie a try. Saw it free on TV and I STILL felt ripped off. I have probably suffered permanent brain damage from watching this atrocity.
1,All over the place!,I downloaded the upgrades for the mouse online and for the week I used it had the problem of trying to keep the pointer from moving where I didn't want it to go. I play online games and it couldn't keep up. I ended up buying the laser mouse and smashing this product with a hammer. That was the only satisfaction I got from using this. I did stick with Logitech and got thier laser mouse which works great. I've always used thier products so one bad apple wasn't going to spoil it for me.
1,poor workmanship,"I wish I would have read all the reviews before I bought this table. Both of the chairs had to be repaired. The wood was split where they were put together. The top of the table looks like the stain has been sprayed on and has dry spots. I am very disappointed, but didn't feel like spending the extra money to send it back. I just paid someone to fix the chairs. For this kind of money I would have expected better quality."
2,Ana Gabriel en la Plaza de Toros Mexico,"This was a very nice video, good selections of songs and most of her popular songs were included in this video. If you like Ana Gabriel, she will love this DVD concert. I was only dissappointed that the song Ay Amor was not included in this concert, but overall this DVD is worthed to have in any collection."
1,K-cup reusable coffee filter,"Terrible. Don't purchase! I purchased this as a gift for my husband. First, I received SIX reusable filters in one box. I must not have read the description. So, read the description. Second, we used one filter and there was coffee everywhere but in the cup. I am going to try to return them all."
1,good for small children,"i found this book pretty dull. i guess if i were 9 or 10, it would be more interesting. it is, however, easy to understand."
2,Arrresting,"Excellent! If you enjoy masterful musicianship this is a must see. Summers is magnificent on guitar, Sting is a virtuoso on bass and his voice sounds impeccable and Copeland is wondrous on the drums."
1,Sad editing process in Kindle edition,I agree with Ken and want to add that the typographical errors in the Amazon Kindle edition made it almost unreadable. Please have some technician correct this!It did provide me with valuable information and connections about the Colorado/Denver people and an early perspective on that history.
2,Like.. Like!,If you have always desired those towel racks that are used in high-end hotels.Then this is the product for you.They come completely dismantled so you can easily carry them overseas in your travel bag.I have a couple of units and they are still shining with no rust even after >12 months of usage.
2,Extensive descriptions of trails,"This book has very detailed descriptions and good maps of Florida's paved bike trails. It's great for anyone who is looking for places to ride, whether you're trying to stay away from traffic or planning a trip."
1,Different version for the same item??,"I bought one of these about a year ago, and bookmarked it so I could always come back and buy a duplicate. I just received my 2nd order of this today, and it's slightly different. The handle isn't fully leather, so it's not as stiff as the original book I ordered, and when you open it, the sides feel like the vinyl version of this book, so those things really kill it for me. It's a shame. I don't feel like going through the process of shipping it back because it's not the end of the world, but what is the deal with updating a product without updating the product page?"
2,R C Airplanes,Seems to work fairly well for rc airplanes although sometimes it is hard to pick them up. Appears to be fairly accurate.
1,Very Disappointing,This book was written in an annoyingly cliched manner that greatly detracts from the subject.
2,The Manfred Mann Anthology to own,"Two CDs of everything meaningful that was released by the group between 1963 and 1969. It includes many singles not available elsewhere like 'Semi-detached Suburban Mr. James,' and 'My Name is Jack.' The compilation benefits from the addition of material released from fragments/spin-offs of the original mob; I didn't know that McGuiness-Flint, for example, came out of Manfred Mann. And, for those who thought the group was little more than an interpreter of songs by US writers, the set shows that - while eclectic at times - Manfred Mann was a pretty great band."
2,caution if you're caffeine sensitive,"I drink a lot of tea and I don't drink coffee, the main reason being I am apparently one of those wussy types who are highly sensitive to caffeine. I had a grande size Awake this afternoon at Starbucks and several hours later I am still recovering. I am no longer nauseous and shaky but I am still hyper. As tea taste goes I like it--it's neither better nor worse than average--but for someone like me (and yes, I realize this is not the norm for most people) it is too caffeinated. I thought I'd put this out there for anyone else who might experience the same kind of jolt since it isn't really a good feeling. I will keep Awake in mind though if I ever find that I need to build a house in 24 hours or complete a full year of graduate work in a week."
1,This used to be a singles compilation w/B sides,"the original release of Staring at the Sea contain the B-sides to all the singles on Side2 of the cassette. THAT WAS THE BEST PART!!! You listened to all the hits from side1, flipped the tape and descended into pure Cure weirdness for another 35 minutes. There is quite simply no reason not to include the B-sides on this re-issue, even as a double-disk. Hopefully Rhino takes the hint."
1,you know what it's about.,"This movie is about rape. A very graphic rape happens in the movie and then there are a bunch of long, drawn out scenes that will put most to sleep. If you can handle all that, you might like it. I know they were trying to be shocking or whatever. but it was just contrived and boring. Just an opinion. I wouldn't pay $20 for it."
1,pyle 2400watt amp,"ok the first day i got it, it never worked the lights dont even come on and my friend does hook ups for a living and he said its something wrong on the inside"
1,"Another ""Shorted"" Customer","Ordered this to build some speaker cables for our church monitors. Fairly good wire, good guage (fyi - it is very close to actually being 12 gauge, which surprised me). Holds up to solder well. BUT...it is NOT 100' of cable. As with others, we are 10 feet short of 100'.I had red the reviews, and took a chance because we needed clear cable that would ""hide"" well in the Sanctuary. Cable carries voltage well, little resistance change, pushing 4 ohm with no problem or heat buildup. Given all this - I have to ask...why are you shorting us 10 feet in cable? If you had advertized this as 90' - I would still have purcahsed it."
2,Doggie chews,"My pug loves these chews. When I accidentally leave the door open where I keep them, she has her nose in there looking for them. They are her final treat of the day and she can hardly wait for them. After eating her food she jumps up on the chair and stares at me or if I don't see her she barks at me until she gets my attention so I can look and see she ate her food. Then she runs over to the closet waiting for me to give her one. I wish I could be so easily placated and satisfied."
2,Good Song,"Can you feel it ,see it, hear it today?If you can't, then it doesn't matter anywayYou will never understand it 'cause it happens too fastAnd it feels so good, it's like walking on glassFAITH NO MORE"
2,A Warm & Very Funny Book for Kids,"I can't believe there's any problem with this funny, smart , and warm book ! On the last page, we meet the brother of The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln--his name is Dickie and he looks just like Dick Nixon. He even has a TAPE RECORDER and is making two V's for Victory! Anyone who interprets ""Dickie"" in another way has no sense of history and a VERY DIRTY MIND."
2,Good music from the Boss,"I enjoyed this Video anthology of ""the Boss"". It had a lot of my favorite songs and a few new ones I had not heard before. (They actually were not new songs, but I hadn't heard them before). There was a repeat of one or two songs. But one of the repeats of Born In The USA was an acoustic version and I think I preferred that version to the original one that was released.Over all I was pleased with my purchase!"
2,Great Deal for the Price,"This camera has a lot of really good features, at a price that won't kill your wallet. Excellent picture quality and audio, plus the ability to dump the video to your PC to edit via the firewire connection. It's compact, easy to use and has some cool effects built in for 'on the fly' editing. Excellent value!"
1,"If you want to have fun, don't read this book.","I found this book highly unenjoyable. It was written well, if you are taking a doctorate level course, otherwise good luck. If you expect to learn what a Greek Myth is, Kirk will confuse the hell out of you!!! He does an excellent job of never giving his own opinions, but would rather belittle the thoughts of previous authors on the nature and beliefs of Greek Myths. Sorry Kirk, but I would have to give you two thumbs down for ease of reading, comprehension, and explanations on the Greek Myths."
2,Good concept,"I really like this litter pan it is super big though, almost too big for our rabbit cage. My rabbit can get it off the side of the cage though which was my main reason for purchasing."
1,Can't belive I spent my hard earned money on this!!!,"I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for my husband. We live in Virginia, in the U.S.A. And when we went to play his new movie it said Region Error. So evidentally Amazon sold us a movie that can only be played in Europe. WOW!"
2,The best brand I've tried,"I've been taking quercetin for over 10 years. This brand was recommended by my OMD. I've tried several other brands over the years but always come back to this one. It's not always easy to find, though."
1,I'm sorry to say I don't like it.....,"I'm sorry to say I dislike this because the concept of a ""return to the old school sound"" was exciting. I have been a fan for so long it really dates me. I have seen them in concert twice. I have almost all their records, my favorites being the Garage Days, Master of Puppets, and Justice for all, Black album....I even like the S&M; stuff.The SOUND on this record is SO DISAPPOINTING, it gets really tired after a few songs. It sounds too much the same. The drum sound is just not appealing to me. Hetfield's voice is strained.I almost think they should have ""quit while they were ahead"" and broken up after Newsted left/was let go/ whatever.Even the DVD is a disappointment because they are in a boring rehearsal studio for every song.The speed is a return to the old Metallica and they still have some good hooks and riffs. I actually appreciate less guitar solo work but I can't emphasize enough how much I hate the sound. Especially the drums. Oh well."
2,Essential Book for any Traveler to Tokyo!,"I was just checking back with Amazon to see if there is a new version of this indispensable book. I travel to Tokyo for leisure annually and would not dream of going without this book. I actually had a nightmare a couple of weeks ago that I arrived in Tokyo without this book!As other reviewrs have said, this book will allow you to make sense of the unusual Japanese address system. Very importantly as well, it will help you in deciding which station exit to take as you travel around the city. When one is dealing with a station like Shinjuku (the world's largest)this is incredibly useful. Locate where you want to be when you come out of the station, and select the appropriate station exit from the map.Can't recommend this one enough!"
2,What's the date?,"This was a 1st time experience, buying a watch online. Overall, the watch is what I was looking for, and I have already ordered another one.My only criticism is the face, all be it quite large, is very hard to read. My eyes aren't what they once were, but I should be able to make it out."
2,Just Press Play,"I love this album despite the negative reviews I have read so far. This album will get you high on music while we enjoy the vibe. This album is a love story, a sly romantic tale of two peopl who meet, seduce each other, fall in love, and then experience the inevitable pain of that love breaking. This album, underneat that, is the tale of a dream, a helpless romantic who is balancing the dreamstate of his passions with the passions with the passions of his dreams coming true. The tracks spans the realm of Diddy expressing himself. This album is inspired by the movements of bodies in dark after-hours spots all over the world, those sexual, sensual places where the music is the beat but the vulnerability of meeting someone new and dancing with them for the first time offers up all kinds of possibilities. This album really reflects that. This album has been certified PLATINUM. This album was destined to be successful."
1,AWFUL!,"This movie had the most pointless plot and sappy dialouge i have ever seen. The romance in the movie was completely ruined by the cheap, unbelieveable, LENGTHY dialouge. Pointless characters, and uninteresting plot. Overall, this film was 1 hour 56 minutes too long. TOTAL MOVIE CRUD!"
2,I love the New addition of The Silver Spoon,The new edition has more color photographs. Recipes are very well written. Additional recipes are a welcome addition. I love it.
1,Not the best darts...,"Pros: Nice case, comes with everything you need to play, spare parts and some extras, dart tool it comes with is small but effective.Cons: Included parts are very cheaply made, flights come off easily, too heavy for the length of tip they include, the paint will flake away and even faster yet if your darts don't stick and hit the floorAll I can really say, is if you purchase these darts, have shorter tips available, and switch out the shafts for the metal like ones it comes with. Overall, this package needs some work, and I wouldn't suggest these darts to someone who is interested in shooting darts. I would only suggest these to the person who has a dartboard at home and wants to try some heavier darts than the small plastic ones."
1,avoid this company,"I am in complete agreement with Aaron, avoid this model and Xact. After 1 month unit froze up with Sirus displayed. Two weeks after warranty retun was asked to send the remote or $5.95 or they won't fix it. The bad control head has nothing to do with the remote! Good luck ever talking to a human on the ""cusomer service"" number."
1,Great book for all ages,"I just finished reading this wonderful novel for my english class. I read enjoyed everything about the book, from start to finish. Beals does an incredible job of giving the reader so much detail that he/she feels they are right there with Melba as she endures the struggles of going to Central High School. Although the book does get depressing at times, it is definetly worth reading the 300+ page book, because the ending is what really ties the book together."
1,Not a great wiper,"I bought the Bosch ICON Wiper Blade and the Bosch Excel+ Wiper Blade for my front windshield. I couldn't decide which one to buy so I bought one of each to compare and use. The Excel+ has held up better and wipes longer without smearing. Overall, the Excel+ has been a MUCH better blade. The ICON relatively quickly started to give small lines smears. The Excel+ works great one year later - not sure why a company would need to develop a more expensive wiper that doesn't work as well."
1,Sure to Fail,"Like a cheap Rolex you get off the streets of NYC, this falls into the same category. Except those cheap Rolex once made in Hong Kong at least lasted longer that this Apex made in China."
1,For only the most advanced and patient users....,"I bought this product to use with my Garmin etrex GPS unit. The website claims it is compatable, but it turns out it is not. I was unable to successfully navigate or use more than about 10% of the features, and I consider myself a moderate to advanced user. Another negitive thing about this program is the fact it comes with NO instruction manual! Tech support is a long distance call, available only during very limited hours. Finally, navigating around any map requires constant reloading which takes forever. I have a $3500 computer,as fast as they currently make them and I found myself waiting for images to load constantly. Do yourself a favor and try another program."
1,Terrible image on this Synergy DVD!,"THE SLEEPING TIGER is a terrific film with a knockout performance by Dirk Bogarde in his first collaboration with director Joseph Losey.It deserves to be seen in a clear print. This Synergy Entertainment DVD and its smudgy print is a travesty. Do they preview these films before they sell them to unsuspecting buyers?If you can't play a reg. 2 DVD, pristine image from Optimum....... get the reg. 1 ""Dark Crimes - 50 Movie DVD Set"" from Mill Creek Entertainment under $12 for 50 films. Don't be put off by the ""50 movies"" bit. Their print of THE SLEEPING TIGER is as clear as you're going to get, and as good as the Optimum. I stumbled on this great find and was amazed. It's also available through some interlibrary loans so you can check it yourself.Good luck."
2,Good product. Highly overpriced.,"Recommended, only if you need it for games saves and profiles. Comes with an Arcade game, but can only be accessed while the unit is in the slot. I got this for a little over $[...] new. Any higher and I would look the other way. Only purchase if the price is less than $[...] new.Hopefully next generation Microsoft will allow for memory sticks via the USB ports."
1,This game is a HUGE dissapointment!,"I was looking forward to this game so bad that it was all I could think about for days before it came out. Well, I was greatly dissapointed! The graphics are BLAH at best. The game play is choppy and bumpy. The XBox processor can do much better than this. When are game designers going to utalize the XBox's true potential? This game looks like junk and is NOT fun...this makes me sad. I really wanted to like it. RENT IT FIRST!"
1,Hollywood & Vines,"Yup, it'll be a movie for sure.I won't bother reiterating all the other negative reviews, nor will I slog through over three hundred reviews in total... but if no one has mentioned this already--If you want to a thoughtful, well written and frightening story about killer plants, try John Wyndham's Day of the Triffids instead of this swill."
1,Wrong message to children,"I don't know if the other reviewers have actually read this book, but I can't understand how they rave about a story that sends an awful message to children. Max drives away when he's told that he can't have ice cream for breakfast, and he gets ice cream for breakfast when he goes to Grandma's. Is that the message you want to give to your kids?!?I wish I could give this book ZERO stars. My son received it as a gift and I'd like to get rid of it; I think I'm going to recycle it rather than give it to anyone I know."
1,"Nice try, but...","Frustrating. There are a lot of good tips in how to use the Interdev product, but the book could use a good editing job. You're not sure at times when the author is attempting to run you through an example or just giving you general information. It's also frustrating because a number of areas that would be extremely useful to the developer (Server scriplets, DMTL scriptlets, and so forth) are either glossed over or poorly explained. Some areas of the book (the UI, where certain properties and options are found) are obviously based on betas of the InterDev 6 release which have subsequently changed. In short, a nice try but unless you;'re a total beginner on web development, look elsewhere."
2,Saw the Show in Dallas,"Not what I expected....no characters, sets...just the music, a great little band, and great voices. I bought the CD at the show ($25 including the program) and am ripping it as we speak. I cant think of too many of the great tunes that they left out. Really well done!!"
1,Stinker,"I hate to use that word when referring to the Brothers but this movie was dull and uneventful. It's was like no one took the time to write a few scenes/sketches in the classic Marx style that we know and love. The big chase at the end seemed to belong more in a Buster Keaton silent flick and was really not the Mark Brothers style AT ALL. Not as disgusting an effort as AT THE CIRCUS, but this runs a close second as the worst Marx film of them all. (I have yet to see Room Service) Not terrible, just uneventful. Rent before you buy."
1,Try again.,This hour long film spends more times at a paint ball park than it does in Chicago. Do you think this is an accurate representation of Illinois? It totally forgot the side of Illinois that borders the Mississippi. Try again.
1,SUCKS,This hoop set is not worth it's price! The backboard's screw measurements were way off from the bar's screw measurements. The arrows didn't work on both the original set and the replacement set. And the score board wires are way sensitive to the vibrations from the shooting that it turns off and on.
1,Syrupy and simple,"Bono's vocals are troubling in this album. Some of the songs sound like they came right out of the 1960s! The songs are rambling and almost 'forced' and exasperated, and lack intensity and passion, two things Achtung Baby was loaded with.This is NOTHING like Joshua Tree, either."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I just received this product in the mail today and tested it out on my iPhone and computer, but it never worked it would not work on one ear and would screw-up what the track was playing. Waste of money."
2,Very Thought-Provoking,"This book is laid-out very well and quickly draws you in. You must be patient when reading the book. Many points that are made throughout come together later. Evidence (some perhaps coincidental) mounts as you are taken from continent-to- continent, and you are also versed in map-making and astronomy. You can't help but to take notice. I almost gave this book a 4 (instead of a 5) due to its shear size, but you just have to stay with it. Have fun!"
2,Achoo,This is a very fun story for the pre-reader. Elmo blows the town apart with sneezes from place to place and travels in the company of all familiar friends.For 3-4 dollars - great buy.
2,one per order,very cute. maybe it was just me but i thought all 3 came as package. only one per order. i was also unable to choose which design i wanted. its a little lightweight and frictionless for pets to climb on but otherwise great product.
1,Best summer film of 03,"I saw this movie in theatres and loved it i thought it was extremely well done and right then i knew i had to get it on DvD when it was finally released. I only had a few bones to pick and those were mostly about jason. Kane Hodder didnt play him, and Ken kizinger well he moved to fast for jason he made jason look like he was at a medium walking pace through the whole thing. Jason is supposed to be a stalking killing machine not a marathon jogger. Other than that it was probably one of the best films i saw all summer. I already pre-ordered my copy of the DvD and i would definetly recommend this film to hard core fans of both horror icons, even if your not big in this kinda of movie you will get alot of pleasure out of seeing it."
2,good clean fun,"I remember seeing this guy years ago when he would come out in a cowbay hat and say "" howdee bet you didn't expect that "".I thought he was funny then and still do. This guy focuses in on real life and does it by being clean using obsevations of how we really act.Most comics today just expouse filth and catch phrases to shock us.I can watch this video with my family or church friends and not be ashamed,much in the same way as Bill Cosby's ""Himself"" from years ago.This is entertaining and very funny.If Carlos Mencia would just clean up his routines about observation he could be this entertaining and have a more broad appeal."
2,Under rated God Sim,"This was one of my favorite games growing up. You are God and you alter terrain. Sounds simple enough. There is one guy on an uneven terrain and you must flatten out the land for him in order for him to survive. He will build a hut and expand the kingdom. As long as your terrain is flat enough, he will eventually build up a castle/kingdom and more people will come from the houses and huts. Here is the really fun part. As you are doing this, the other side of the map is also being changed with other inhabitants. Those are your peoples enemies and they will fight each other. The more people you have, the stronger your forces will be. You can elect a person to be a knight and fight off their forces individually. Once your moral meter is raised high enough, you are able to cause earthquakes, floods, volcanoes. Overall, all you are really doing is altering terrain so your people will build a society for the sole purpose of global domination."
1,Wow. This is terrible.,"I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when our ""hero,"" the man who is supposed to train the heroine and help her defend herself against her abusive husband, exhibited all the signs of an abusive man.Note to author: It isn't sexy or romantic or exciting when a man constantly and aggressively presses himself against a woman. It isn't believable that a woman who had suffered constant and horrifying abuse at the hands of her husband would return a forced kiss. The way the initial scenes between these two characters were written was positively vomit-inducing. Lazy writing, straight from the handbook of the bodice-rippers, but with an extra dose of violence.Rape culture, in a nutshell. What a piece of crap."
1,3 useless phone system aggrevating to no end.,"This system only allows one handset to be ""online"" at a time. That means if two people in the household want to talk with grandma at the same time they cant! If you answer the phone downstairs and someone upstairs wants to pick up the phone too and talk they can't..at least not until the person downstairs hits the transfer button and now he can no longer talk without the upstairs person transfering back.. duh duh dumb.. so not user friendly. This is a so called security feature more like an annoying feature that I wish I could turn off."
1,a rehash of old people and newsweek articles,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. If you have read any old articles on JFK Jr. in People magazine or Newsweek, you have read this book. Plus, the author lifted most of information from earlier written books on Jackie. The first and last chapter were the only chapters spent on the day John died. The rest of the chapters are on how Jackie raised John. I could have clipped out articles from People, Newsweek and the Enquirer, thrown in old photos and written this book."
1,not durable enough,The paint wears away rather quickly from use. Then the metal chips/flakes off and leaves residue inside your firearm. I wish they weighed more to simulate carrying live ammo. Too expensive for what your getting. Sorry.
1,"Daughter hated it, Pharmaceutical propaganda","I bought this based on positive reviews.Pros: Somewhat cute and bouncy animation.Cons: #1 My daughter had zero interest in it, I also found it very boring. #2 It's basically just a pharmaceutical advertisement, which I find extremely offensive. The fact that they are targeting parents and children is horrifying.Stick to Seasame Street and Yo Gabba, and Pixar."
2,Perego 12 volt battery charger,Purchased this charger for an electric car for my grand daughter. The charger works fine and she is gettig alot of enjoyment out of the car.
1,Save your money,"There is so much more to the imaginary London than the author conveys. This book feels like it was dictated to complete an assignment. Buy the Ackroyd book, London: A Biography instead...and then use your own imagination. I agree with previous reviewers who called it superficial with the real book still waiting for an author to write it."
1,As Seen on TV,"I really wanted to like these cookies. The TV show, ""Unwrapped"", made them look sooo good. However, my family was gravely disappointed. They arrived in a huge paint can with a tiny little foil bag inside. When we took our first bite it was like eating a dry, breaded piece of citrus candy. A unique flavor, but not one our family appreciated."
1,BS&T - More Than Ever CD,"I am a huge BS&T fan, and was very disappointed in this CD. It was supposedly done in the early 1970's when the band was dolling out hit after hit, but only one or two of the songs are halfway decent. I sort of feel like I've been fed a bad line about this CD, and would not recommend anyone else wasting their hard earned dollars on it."
2,Princess Cloe,"Hi! I am a huge Cloe fan, and I'm starting to like Jade a little more now too. I also love Meygan due to the fact that her little icon is a monkey. I received the very first Cloe doll a couple years ago and I still have her. I also have the new Rock Angelz Cloe and I recently compared the two, and I started thinking about something. I don't like the bleach blonde and the wayyyyy overshined purplish lips of the original. The very cute brown and blonde mix of hair and the less shiny more natural lips of Rock Cloe and Princess Cloe look far more refined and pretty. I am putting my Rock Angelz Cloe on display, buying room sets, fashion packz, and the Princess Cloe doll and I will use her as my main Bratz Cloe doll.Really, compare the two..."
2,Low Impact is a must,Great DVD...you have to work in some low impact workouts sometimes gang to give your body a break and not to feel guilty about not going 110% all the time. Great DVD.
2,We love Little Bear!,"My 3 year old daughter loves Little Bear. It airs on Noggin just in time for me to make dinner and it is her wind down time during the day. When she is feeling sleepy or just needs some quiet time, Little Bear always does the trick. The DVD is great with so many episodes. My daughter and I were more than happy with it. I would recommend this for any child between 2 and 6. (Actually I catch my older kids watching sometimes too!!)"
1,"Looks like fun, but...","My dad bought the kit so I went home and built it and I thought it was cool because the legs moved and it had CHEWBACCA! But the legs only shuffled but did not lift up over things. So it did nt really walk. It's like a TIE fighter that looks good on the shelf, but does not play too well. It plays well with Ewoks and Snowspeedrs, but I would like this better if I had an AT-AT to go with it."
2,The True Babylon 5 Starts here,"The first season was unfocused, here is where the real Babylon 5 starts. Major story elements like the Shadows and Captain Sheridan start in the season."
2,"Great Game, But Hard Space Battles!","This is a great game, but the complaint I have are the space battles. Why can't be like the original Battlefront where there is no boost or those hard to destroy turrets! Or the fighters can be faster without the boost, so overall its just fast, but can make it slow! Rise of the Empire is a little hard. I'm on the Polis Massa level, but I almost beat the level(I only had one more Objective left!)Then my reinforcement force count depleted! I wish instead of restarting the level, you can restart teh objective. I heard that the Jedi can block rifle fire but I can't find the block button! Where is it! Can the next reviewer tell me!"
2,Use a Lithium Battery!,"I purchased the TuneJuice to watch movies on long flights. At first I tried my used batteries from my smoke detectors. They tested good but did not extend the battery life of my iPod at all. I got through about three hours of movies and the iPod died. Next I tried the battery that came with the TuneJuice and had the same result. I was going to send it back when I saw a 9V Lithium battery by Energizer at Home Depot for about $7 and decided to give it one more try.... Bingo! Using the Lithium 9V did the trick. I just flew from west coast to east coast and watched movies on the iPod the whole way. Two days of travel with about 12 hours total on that battery and when I unplugged it from the iPod, the IPod's battery was still fully charged. Plus the lithium battery is lighter than the regular alkaline battery."
2,Historian seeks bloodsucking fiend...,"Aside from the overwhelmingly prevalent descriptory language of this novel (yes, I get it, you've traveled), the plot is a rather new taste of the old Dracula dinner. Rather than being an ancient fiend set solely on destruction and desire for blood, this Vlad Drakulya is a lover of books and goes around turning librarians into his devilish acolytes.Told in the same manner as Bram Stoker's Dracula, this book slowly reveals its story of 79 chapters through a series of letters from one of the various characters to another. While some might find this modus operandi rather tedious (as I did at first), if you ""stick with it,"" it will get more interesting around Chapter 50, and the last 29 chapters won't be so very dull at all."
1,Stopped working after a month,This was perfect (was using it to light the top of our stairs at night) until the motion sensor just stopped working.
2,It's a beautiul thing,An excellent overview of the op-tops' career. The liner notes alone are worth a full price CD. The new songs brought a welling of rezzy love to my heart that I hadn't felt since college. I hope affordability doesn't push them into mainstream listenership.
1,nothing worth reading,"This was the required text for an English Comp class. For the class we were required to read three stories from this book. First of all let me say that I am not a traditional college student. I am a middle aged man working on an Engineering Degree that I should have gotten many years ago. I digress. I say this to point out that my opinions are not those of a 19 yr old college freshman.There is alot of talk about liberal indoctrination of college students. Well here it is.There may be a mainstream story in this book, but I only read about how we should feel sorry for inner city blacks that wind up in prison, one about how mistreated the Palestinians are and one about how latent homosexuality is to blame for violence in the world.To put it mildly I do not recommend this book if you can possibly avoid it...."
2,"A RARE FILM OF BEAUTY, ELOQUENCE, DECENCY","A RARE DECENT AND MOVING FILM, THIS, WHICH BOTH AWES WITH ITS BEAUTY AND CAUSES ONE TO CARE ABOUT ITS CHARACTERS. IT IS A FILM TO WATCH WITHOUT ANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS. THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS AMAZING. EACH SHOT, EACH WORD IS WELL CHOSEN, AND THE EFFECT IS MAGIC. AND, UNLIKE MANY ART FILMS, THE DRIVING PLOT DRAWS ONE IN ENTIRELY. THIS IS A CLASSIC."
2,3 ring punche pads,I like 3 ring punched pads so I can put my notes into binders without having to find my punch. I found expensive heavy weight ones at office max. So of course I wnt to Amazon and found exactly what I wanted at an appropriate price
1,For fundamentalist Christians only!,"This book was recommended to me by my physician. He wanted me to learn about different types of depression, their causes, and possible treatments. I read the review here and thought, ""Well, I can take a little Christianity along with the psychologically helpful information the book will provide.""Boy, was I wrong! This book is a little bit of the basic psychology of depression and a bunch of Christian propaganda along with it...This book ended up making me more depressed than before I read it. It's depressing to think that the majority of our country is populated with people who share his biased opinions about humanity."
1,stay away from ncstar products,remember the saying: that you get what you pay for. the one i purchased did not work.I have also had experience with other items in this manufacturers line up.spend the extra money for a good unit or you will be wasting time in returns.its not worth the chance you may get a good item.
2,Sonic Mastery,"Although I really like the old Sonic Youth, this is just as good. It's the same base substance but more sculpted, nuanced, and harnessed. It's one of the best CDs of the year. It keeps getting better every time I listen to it. I got no complaints; all the songs are great in their own way. They got the skrills to pay the bills and to provide the thrills. All in all, a very worthy investment."
1,atrocious,"This is the worst PC game I have ever played. I'm very suspicious of the ""reviewers"" up here giving it 5 stars. Don't waste your money on this pile."
2,Fools,"Nikki,nico, and others. Who does it better? Meshuggah, slipknot?... dillenger is Juliard trained in classical guitar. Find me a better jazz/grindcore fusion metal band and I might respect your unfounded opinions."
1,Handmade junk,"My sister gave this puzzle to my 3-year-old and within the first day the graphic was peeling off of at least half of the pieces under supervised use. I guess now ""hand-crafted"" is just marketing rhetoric."
1,The One Star,"The one star is for the only ONE good song on this cd. Tubthumping...Actually, this song blows after you hear it more than 5 times. This cd has only been in my cd player once...That is the day i bought it. If you like wasting money, buy this cd."
2,Simple but functional,"Think cell phone gel skin. The Kindle Fire slips nicely into this case. It provides a modicum of protection for the Kindle without adding any weight or bulk. I bought one for each family member that received a Kindle for Christmas. Each got a different color, and that allowed everyone to easily identify their device. It also makes it a bit easier to grasp/hold. It was the least expensive Kindle case I saw online."
1,So so...,Easy to read. Pretty Pics...but I thought it was a waste of my money. Have gotten better ideas from one magazine than this entire book. Go to the library to check it out & save your money.
2,Wonderful writer,"I loved the Sword of Shannara and have read it several times. Terry Brooks is a wonderful writer. He is detailed enough that he is able to create clear images without slowing down the story with too many details. The world he creates seems to exist, it has a past and a future, its peoples have faults and attributes, the places are concrete. His characters are real, each one with faults and victories. Beyond his writing style the story is also captivating. The journey over the land, the dangers faced and the people encountered allow for the reader to get swept up in an adventure."
1,Save your Money for a microphone cable!!!,This book is $35.00 I'll never get back. Better off blind folding yourself and working your toe's.
2,BLOCKS CARBS,LOVE THIS AND ALWAYS LOSE WEIGHT WHEN I TAKE IT BEFORE EACH MEAL HATE TO RUN OUT OF IT. HAVE USED THIS FOR 5 YEARS WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS
1,PUFF DADDY IS A JOKE!,"Here's one for the two-triple-0! I didn't know this character back in '91 & i wish i didn't know him now! This album is seriously lacking in dope beats. This s**t is wack, man. Keep it real with some explosive west coast s**t."
2,"Good, although dated","I used this book for a Micro course and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The quality of scholarship is unsurpassed. My only real beef is that it only has one paragraph about environmental concerns, and with the impending ecological crisis, such cursory treatment is insufficient. Also, the 1993 publication date means that there is little-to-no coverage of such recent developments as NAFTA and the WTO. Maybe the author will come out with a Ninth Edition?"
1,"music 4, sound quality 1 (at best!)","we all know bird was one of the best.but...the SQ of these recordings is revolting. constant hiss on 90% of the tracks makes headphone listening imposible(only on ""just friends is it realy clear). were the masters destroyed?, these songs sound like they were taped off the radio!listen in store if possible...than get something else (by parker, of course:-)"
1,bad experience,"It was not worth the money to return. It did not work from the begining.It accepted the pics ok, but the battery does not last more than 30 min."
2,A hot romance with a lot of Heart!,"Now I admit, I had high expectations for this book. Sometimes that's bad because then the book disappoints. That was not the case with this book! I loved it! Edward is just perfect hero material. I loved Edward and what I loved most about him was the love that he had for his brother. Their scenes together brought tears to my eyes. Now Florence is not a spitfire, she's shy yet she's stronger than she realises. The attraction they feel for each other is instant but she realises that his brother Freddie is safe and Edward thinks that Florence is Freddie's salvation. Thus the conflict. The sexual tension is sizzling. Try as he might, Edward loves Florence and Emma does a great job of letting us know what Edward is going through. I really really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. Emma made us care about all of the characters including Freddie who is struggling over who he is and who his brother wants him to be. This book is about Love in all of it's many facets."
2,Very entertaining!,"I will pursue more works from this author. First book I've actually completed in about 10 years...voluntarily. A fun, chilling, thought provoking read. Loved it on the iPad."
2,What a great book on barbecue,"This book is great. It gives many new and interesting recipies, and is very well written. The only reason that it didn't recieve 5 stars is because I felt that Steven Raichlens book How to Grill was a little better illustrated."
1,Audio not synchronized with the video.,Video is very much delayed with the audio that even my high-end full featured AVR is unable to synchronize them. What a disappointment!
1,Disintegrates,"I just have to echo other reviews regarding this spatula. I bought one and it soon started chipping away, disintegrating, within just a dozen or so uses. I do not recommend and, apparently, many others have had this problem so not unique."
1,revolving playing card holder,The card holder rocks back and forth if there R tomany cards on one side. You have to put the cards all on one side to B able to play the game.
2,Jane Iredale's Liquid Minerals,"Jane Iredale's Liquid Minerals is a wonderful product to use if you have sensitive skin. For years, I used over the counter brands from high dollar department stores and my skin never looked or felt the way that I thought it should have for the amount of money invested.Jane Iredale Liquid Minerals come out of the pump ""lumpy"", but I pump a little on the top of my hand, rub the mineral bubbles a little, then apply with my fingers. The results are always fabulous!"
2,Has hardly left my CD player since I bought it...,"This is the first Switchfoot CD I have purchased (although I did have a couple of their songs on some multiple-artist promo CD I got a few years ago). It was the rare CD that I had purchased purely on word of mouth, but I have really enjoyed it. ""More to Live"" definitely opens up the disc with a great guitar hook and high energy. Other songs have some variety in form/style, but I have always appreciated a band that doesn't use the same formula on every song. Vocals on a couple of songs remind me of Toad the Wet Sprocket's vocalist. Vocals on others are more like other modern-rock bands, although this is definitely NOT a ""Christian band trying to sound like other popular bands"" CD. Plenty of originality in the music and lyrics. One of the best modern rock buys I have made recently."
2,Nice little nightstand,"I purchased this nightstand after reading the reviews and I have to say that for me, it was perfect. Not only an unbelievable price, but it was very easy to assemble, it is very sturdy and it looks great! I have no problems with this product. Please carefully read the instructions and follow them directly -- the nightstand is very very nice! Highly recommended!"
1,Does not work,I have to agree with other reviews on here. This is a piece of junk. I just bought this timer... took it out of the package and it did not work!
1,Boring,"There is nothing new in this book. The author gives semi-interesting background on the Bush family, then follows several rabbit trails from Ozzy Osbourne to Pat Robertson. Disappointing, which is too bad because if the author did some real research this could have been a very interesting book."
1,Not very good.,"Starts out real interesting, but just goes downhill. Author is a good writer, just needs to stick to what he's writing and stop jumping from one event to another. The characters need to be more developed. Wait for the paperback if you have to read it."
2,Pretty good except....,Played this on a friends machine - a dozen or so games.THe game has a really nice feel to it. The lower levels can let you win without performing obvious blunders and that is the one thing that Chessmaster is sadly lacking. This game actually feels like playing a human.Two gripes -1. the graphics are a bit ordinary (2d mode)2. If you get checkmated or checkmate/stalemate or lack of material you cannot choose to 'undo' !!!! the game just ends !The second point is really annoying because I primarily use chess programs to learn
2,"wonderful,cute,suspensful !","This book is great i love it! It is about a shy girl named Amy who feels alone.She finds a dog named Sherlock that could talk they immediatly became friends.Sherlock belongs to a mean scientist who does experiments on him to make him smarter.Sherlock is running away and Amy hides him from the scientist.I won't tell you how it ends,but if you like dogs and mysteries you have to buy this book!!I would recommend this book to 4th,5th and 6th graders.Get this book and trust me you'll be happy with it!"
1,Blah blah blah,"I read this book because the preview for the movie looked good. However, I was extremely disappointed. There was a lot of room for this book to have been good. but it reminded me of made for tv show. The characters were weak and sorry. Don't waste your time....."
2,"Hey, it's still George Jones","This modestly-programmed collection is a good overview of his final work for the MCA label from 1991-98. The disc opens with Jones struggling to feign interest in the rock-oriented ""young country"" sound; the problem was with the formula, not with his singing, which remains great to this day. There are some notable songs, such as ""Wrong Is What I Do Best,"" but where things really started to click is on ""High-Tech Redneck"" and ""Walls Can Fall,"" songs that marked the start of a commercial and creative renaissance that finally got George engaged on an emotional level again. This may be about as much of his music from the period as most folks would need, although diehard fans will also want to track down the original albums."
1,JUST BUY THE FIRST SEASON,"This DVD is just the first 8 episodes of the first season - not really ""Farm Favorites"". I enjoyed them - but wish I had just paid a small amount more and bought the entire first season. The pig, Arnold, wasn't even in these episodes!"
1,Will not last beyond 1 year,"This toaster works, but only for a year. I purchased it in June 2009. 15 months later it became totally unusable. The toaster burns bread at the bottom half in both slots so badly, the bread is inedible. It does it no matter how low the temperature is. And surely, the 12 months warranty expired just before the toaster died. I will never purchase the same brand again."
2,Rock and Roll Will Never Die At this Rate,"Gawd.She knocks me out.A buddy of mine gave me this CD for my birthday. I have been ""infected"" with it since (six weeks).Dirty, dirty rock 'n' roll.I love it.Sorry I can't be more critical, but if you like 4/4 r'n' r you MUST have this album (if you don't already).Chrissy, if you are reading this, I want your babies."
2,Thrillers!,"This book is good. It's about the babysitter name Jenny, who just experience a thrill in her last babysitting job. Jenny doesn't want the job anymore but unfortunately she needed money so bad that she said yes to it. Jenny babysit a very strange 10-year-old boy name Eli Wexner. All the strange things started when she babysit him. She getting some weird phone calls that scare her to dead. A phone call that had happen the last time she babysit. ""I'm back"", ""Hey, babes, are you alone? I'm coming"" were the message that from Mr.Hagen, the man who try to kill her the time she babysit his son. Jenny thought she kill him but she didn't know if Mr.hagen could be back. Is Mr.hagen come back to get his revenge or some weirdo is plotting to kill her?"
2,Delightful and fun...,"I love this book! Consider this a tea party idea book delivered in narrative form. In the beginning we meet Sandy, who invites a few of her closest friends to join her Tea Society and host a tea of their own. They each have very different personalities, which provides inspiration for their party themes. Each chapter is dedicated to a character's tea party and is chock filled with recipes, decorating and hostessing ideas, as well as insights into their personal lives. This is a book I will surely treasure and pass on as gifts for the holidays. It is beautifully written and illustrated, and oh so clever!Enjoy."
1,CHOKING HAZARD,"This product has little knobs under the cover that can easily break off if you have a curious toddler.Do not buy this product. A CD player on a nightstand is just as effective at soothing a baby to sleep. There is no need to have the safety of your baby sacrificed for this ""unneccessary"" little gadget"
2,A Great Book,"This was a great book. I would recommend it to everyone who has children, especially teens."
1,Disappointed!,"I loved the 70's AG, but I couldnt help but think all the way through this CDGawd!He sounds like Tina Turner during her 'Private Dancer' days.(For most folks that would be a compliment)--but 4 AG?no way!'I Can't Stop' seems to sample all the '70s hits and it just doesn't work. I think AG made a secular CD because his friend Willie was ailing.Al Green should take a few lessons from Allen Toussaint.Stay true to Urself!!!"
1,Welcome to the Monkey House,"A decent blockbuster yet a weak film overall, Tim Burton`s ""Planet of the Apes"" is surely lacking. The set design is ok, the costumes are appropriate and some of the acting is actually good, but the characters are flat and the plot is way too contrived. A watchable flick to pass the time, it doesn`t possess the absorbing atmosphere os most of the director`s oeuvre, becoming just another mildly entertaining popcorn-movie. Tim Burton could do better than this by-the-numbers adventure.Watchable but far from memorable."
2,Love this movie,"This is one of my favorite movies, and I agree with the previous reviewers, but, nobody mentioned the wonderful Cole Porter music and the terrific costumes of the era worn by the cast. I also enjoy the dialogs between Diana Rigg and Maggie Smith and also between James Mason and Sylvia Miles."
2,swamis,great cd go out and get it. i know the drummer and he is a real cool guy. as well as is the rest of the band. this is thier second release. first being mainly covers. and is absolutly worth the money and time spent listening to it. even if your not a huge jazz/swing/whatever fan pick it up youll be plesantly suprised.
2,OS X - Worthwhile,I've upgraded to every new version of OSX released since 10.1. Each and every version has been worth the money spent in upgrades. The Time Machine feature alone justifies about half the cost of the ugprade.
2,Best Book I Have Ever Read,"This book is by far the best book I have ever read. I laughed, I cried..the book touched me because I go so into the characters especially John. I hope a sequel will follow so we can know what is next for John and Savannah."
1,Too structured,"The title is far better than the actual book. All it does it make you even more obsessed with food, and now even sugars in fruits are bad! I don't like the strictly outlined nutritional program--I don't think that works for people who ""can't stop eating"". I know that strictly outlined nutritional programs don't work for me. I know from personal experience that most of the time when people can't stop eating, someone giving you a new list of things you can't eat isn't going to help much. All this book did was make me feel more helpless in the face of my binge-eating disorder."
2,Complete Pepin Review,"The information contained in the video was very good and informative. However, I would like to have seen the recipes demonstrated on the video. All in all, not a bad video."
1,Bought in bulk and NONE work,"I bought 10 boxes and absolutely none work. Looked up online and it seems Sony came out with a bunch of DVDs that don't work. They have a way to return them to get your money back if you have the DVDs w/the known numbers on the discs that they know were part of the batch that came out defected.I just haven't had time so ... so far I've wasted my money on 10 boxes of Sony's truly ""BLANK"" DVDS.Never again..."
1,This one star is really a big asterisk,"Take home lessons from the book:- Do not consume high doses of distilled milk casein from cows, it gave lab rats cancer, and- Be sure to review the actual scientific study after reading someone's interpretation of it, the difference between the two can shed a lot of light on the views of the interpreter.In this case, the author misleads readers by exposing them to only a small portion of the original data, omitting information that detracts from his general message that animal protein causes cancer and heart disease. I had a sick feeling of betrayal when this dawned on me.In these days of the ""echo chamber,"" it is important to go the extra mile and think for yourself."
2,A Slice of Americana,"Growing up, I did not have the fortune to listen to Johnny Holliday, but as a sports broadcaster and broadcast educator I quickly became familiar with the man and his work. With the introduction of audio streaming, via the internet, I finally had a chance to listen to Johnny's call. From the computer speakers, I could feel the passion and energy that he has brought to Maryland fans the past 20 plus years, and I made sure to listen as often as possible. Johnny's work also serves as examples, for my students, as to how a game ought to be broadcast. Stephen Moore has written a book that is both entertaining and educational and a must read for any student of the broadcast industry. Now if I can just get him to write a book about Tony Roberts!"
1,This is a joke!,"I usually look at the reviews, but I didn't because I thought that by now (2012) a company would have a grip on what fits what. I'd like to think that you could trust someones word on the fit of such a simple little item such as a shift knob. This knob by this company that I bought it from is a money grab of some type, because shift knobs don't just fit any car. I fell for it. The part itself is fine for wtfever vehicle it is intended for. But I missed the memo on which one it is actually for. Not a 03 Cavalier, and I would have known that if I had taken just a minute to browse the reviews"
1,Disgusted,I like most of Johanna Lindseys books and in fact own all of them but I do not find rape exciting and can not figure how the heroine could fall in love with her tormentor. Oh Well! To each his own.
2,My Husband Loves This,We just bought a house about a year ago . We didn't own a ladder living in apartments so I got this for him as a gift . He loves and uses this all the time. One of my Best purchases.
2,pretty good,"I like it! It does what it says it will do keep you moist in the nasal area. I have chosen though, this is God's season for MIRACLES and I am believing HIM for the miracle of RESTORING MY BODY which includes my sinuses so there is nothing broken and nothing missing."
2,Great combo,"This is a great combination. I use it at work on Toughbooks. Refilling the pen is easy. Just turn the barrel counter-clockwise,pull out the old cartridge,and push in the new one."
1,Future Search,"This book has not been incredibly useful. The authors have some apparently good techniques, however the book is written more like an infomercial. It is as if the book is trying to sell the ""Future Search"" meeting format. I only have the book because I was required to read it for class."
1,A Touch of Cr**,"ATC is supposed to stand for ""A Touch Of Class"" but if ever there was a mis-named group this is it. If this CD has class then George W Bush is a dynamic speaker. It has one memorable tune in ""Around The World"" and the rest is an exercise in mediocrity. This same sounding 'euro-pop' is just an excuse for song writers to churn out the same tune with different words and arrangements. Give it a miss, there are many more CDs out there in this genre that are much more worthy of your money. Try Steps, BBMak, or even Scooch who all have much more variety and energy than this coaster."
2,feedback of Tenchu Wrath Of Heven,"Hi,you can call me ALANA.YOU see,I think that Tenchu Wrath Of Heven should have more stars.I've had it once, I mean not me but my half brother Vince, little Vince.You see, he brought it over to my house.He tought me how to play,I thought it was the bomebigiddy.Then I got stuck with it!It was like A cruse!!! BUT,I still thought it was cool.Becedis,red,black,gray,and white are my favorite colors.And I love the short song and the video in the begining of the game.SO,maybe maybe you should add more stars for Tenchu.I'm I'm not tring to be mean but, it's a really good game.Well I gotta...go now so I hope you guys change your mind about Tenchu.Oh,...BY!!!"
1,"""the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever""!!!!","I really like watching the 15-mins Spongebob Squarepants episodes on TV; they're very innocent and happy, but when I watched this movie I almost lost my head because of the awful it was! This is actually ""the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever"", the critics here in Chile said that and I totally agree with them.The worst thing the producers could do was to include real people and stupid effects that make you laugh in the movie. Like David Hasselhoff, the made fun of himself by acting here!!!! plus, the stupid effect when he starts acting as if he was a boat or something, I had self-shame when I watched that part!!!!!I think that the worst thing you could do is to buy this DVD: you'll watch it once, you'll hate it and you'll waste 18 bucks. Bad purchase."
2,Two Movies In One,"Having the long cut as well as the theatrical cut along with all the deleted scenes makes this like having 2 movies. If you like Will and Zack, you know what you are getting with this movie. Some very funny parts to discuss the next day at work."
1,SUCKS!,"These headphones are terrible! Way different than what other people say on the page....If I didnt know any better, I would say the positive reviews are scams....DONT BUY THEM!!!"
1,not good,this book is very dry. the book merely guides you to do alot of steps. it does not explain the specifications.don't believe me? read the book and try to take the measure up exam and see how you do. i learned more from the exam questions than the dry book
2,Beyond expectation,"I won't buy the idea that the performances were lip-synced. And the violin bow of Mairead was tilted occasionally for a well-known bowing technique for thinner sound, not so that it wouldn't touch the string.It's refreshing to see that ""uniqueness"" doesn't always mean something radically and purposefully different (the concept mostly assumed in the modern art work). As long as the performers individually communicates through their performance, their work will automatically be unique, without the need to convey radically ""new idea"".Not that easy to make these simple, known, and similar style pieces keep catching audience's attention continuously. Orchestration of both voices and instruments is great. And I personnally like the percussion performances. Overall, someone may be able to do differently, but will never be better."
2,Better Than Mr. Coffee,My wife and I really enjoy this tea maker. We had a Mr. Coffee but it always leaked. This one is just a better value and more reliable all around.
1,Don't Waste Your Talent is the same book!!!,"I read a great book by this author called ""Don't Waste Your Talent"" and the information about the lemming conspiracy was fascinating, so I searched for more. When I saw another book by the same author titled ""The Lemming Conspiracy"", I jumped at the chance to learn more. Bottom line, it was the same book as the other I had read. What is up with that????Love the book and certainly worth the read, just make sure you only buy one!Don't Waste Your Talent: The 8 Critical Steps To Discovering What You Do Best"
2,A Must For All Aerosmith Fans,"I am a huge Aerosmith fan, and I also enjoy a little bit of Jazz, bluegrass, blues, etc, so I thought that this would be a good combo, and it is. This is a great album. It is not quite as rockin as Aerosmith, but smokes nonetheless. ""Dream On"" and ""Rag Doll"" are especially good. If you are expecting just a bland recounting of Aerosmith, think again. If you don't like to experiement, don't get this, but real Aerosmith fans understand their bluesy underpinnings and this fulfills those. Highly recommended."
1,S L O W,"We bought this game because we thought it would be entertaining. Turns out, it was the antithesis. There is so much down-time in Stare that if you aren't the one staring at the picture, you might forget you are playing a game all together. If you are looking for a family game that's engaging and fast-paced, save yourself the disappointment and get Bananagrams instead.We tried altering the game several ways, including playing in teams, giving more time to look at the cards, asking our own questions. Nothing worked. The concept of the game is intriguing, but in practice, it doesn't play."
2,it is really good,"it is great, thanks lot, my wife like it, it have many function, and very easy to use.she make a curtern within 2 hours, and it is quite beautiful"
2,FFXI Fanboy Collection for sure!,"The price is a little steep, but if you've got vivid memories of FFXI like I do then this is the ultimate collector's kit for you! With a fantastic collection of 7 discs, a printed score book of the music from the piano solo disc, and lots of great artwork, this will probably be the gem of your Final Fantasy music collection for a long time to come.It includes everything! Some of the most noteworthy are:All 3 main city themesThe Jeuno Christmas holiday remixA Fantastic piano solo of the Windurst city theme.All in all there are hours and hours of music on this collection that any Final Fantasy music lover will cherish forever."
2,Wonderfully bizarre!,"One could describe the setting as grim - urban decay at its worst with a strongly interwoven theme of sterile sexuality. The droning soundtrack adds to the mood of claustrophobia. A spineless protagonist sporting an astonisghing hairstyle finds himself trapped in a world without logic, a land of dreams where anything can happen. Cooked chickens rhythmically spurt out blood at the dinner table, the Lady in the Radiator systematically squashes blobs of semen (life/) in her dance routine and an E.T. lookalike, mutant baby explodes on screen. Don't look for a conventional narrative. Rather the film represents an exploration of post-modernistic themes. Don't walk in with expectations. You'll find sexism, comedy, contradictions - anything is possible. This is not a simple film. Full marks to Eraserhead for its unconventional perspective."
1,Leaks,Basically works okay. Seems to have plenty of power. Very loud. Would not recommend it due to the extensive leaking.
2,Chilling,How can we read fiction and know that it can surely be true. There is no doubt that if these things are not happening now we can be assured they will soon. Albeit fiction I surely hope we have people like Jake Grafton and Tommy and some of the others out there in hot pursuit. This novel carried all the ability to keep you reading on and on. I sincerly enjoyed this one as I have the others read. I would highly recommend this book exspecially to someone that has not read Mr. Coonts in the past.
1,A great disappointment,"I am a great fan of Colin Firth. Even he could not redeem this film for me. For me, the plot,the characters, the writing, the lack of organization of the film and its camera work were fatal flaws. That a 10 year old would cover the eyes of the driver when the driver was driving 60 miles an hour down a busy highway is simply not believable. I found both children unsympathetic. The father seemed to let the girls do what they wanted with no supervision.I saw no sense of continuity in the film and it just seemed to stop at the end with no resolution after a series of disjointed episodes."
1,Step On A Crack,"I used to enjoy coasting with Patterson's novels. This one, even with a collaborator, just didn't create much excitement for me. Parhaps it was because it followed Patterson's old tried-and-true patterns. At any rate, it's not a too-unpleasant way to spend a weekend beside the fire."
2,Close Encounters of the Third Kind,This movie is classic Science Fiction and one of my favorites. I highly recommend this movie to anyone liking Sci-Fi. One of Steven Spielberg's finest.
2,Glad to Have It,I went from a transfer bench to this. No more water on the floor and it fits fine in our tub. It's very solid and sturdy.
1,Where's the Beef?,"I am always up for a ""movie challenge"" but this film had me in stitches. Johnny Depp and the mystery woman ride away on their bike..hair not moving...background that's obviously fake...Was this made in the 70's? Also, the sex scene at the end with the mystery woman...the wild face...the terribly fake and overdone background coupled with even more hilarious music...I just could not get past the cheesy effects without howling with laughter...even the scene showing the dead Baroness in the wheelchair...more humor than fright. Sorry, I wasn't impressed, but if you like campy...it's great!!!"
1,Plan Plus for Outlook trial download - it [is not good],"DO NOT try the Plan Plus trial download. It is really buggy especially when synching with Palm. Had to hard reset my Palm and reinstall my Palm stuff on my laptop.Installation seemed easy enough. Sluggish when launching Outlook. Synching created three e-mail fields on my Palm. First field contained the name of the contact, with garbage in the other 2 fields. Lost 95% of my e-mail addresses. No confirmation message when deleting mail from Delete folder. Activating a ""mailto"" in a webpage is very slow. Looks like FranklinCovey wanted to get the product out the door for a Fall launch more than anything else.Perhaps technology should be left to the people who know it. And FC should concentrate on its core competencies."
2,Great,I ordered the O2 sensor and it arrived the next day. It was perfect for what I needed to pass emissions in the state of GA. It arrived faster than me buying and installing it locally since it takes me a couple of days to put it in as long as my vehicle is operable.
2,Important ideas!,"I am surprised by the reviews which suggest this book is nonsense, unsupported, or unscientific. A chapter averages 25 footnotes, twice that for the longer chapters. Healy admits from the very beginning (and throughout) that she is very aware that these areas of research are not able to _prove_ the ideas in this book. But she tracks down the objective data that is available to develop her thesis that children are in need of good language models and interaction with their environment."
1,buyer regret,i bought this item because of the high reviews. i regret it. the iron drips and leaks. i will never buy this brand again. way overpriced for the quality. no support from the company website. avoid this product at all costs.
1,Not waht it was made out to be.,"This movie was a huge letdown after all the hype about it. It's predictable and the story line isn't all that great. Also it wasn't really scary. After struggling to stay awake, I fell asleep watching it."
1,Almost the Worst Ever,"I can't imagine how this tasteless, ridiculous, boring movie ever got any good ratings. You have a man talking to his boil! And promoting advertising at the end of the movie (because he went crazy?)."
2,Wonderful CD,I got this cd about 3 years ago for my birthday and from the moment I put it in the cd player I loved it. This is probably one of my favorite celine dion cds and I own them all. I love the song Calling You and I also really love the song Elle. This is a beautiful cd and well worth the money. This cd is worth the money alone just for the song Calling You. This is a beautiful cd and a must buy for any celine dion fan or someone who just wants to listen to a great cd.
2,Love it,I ordered the album the night before it was released. but i listened to the music that is on it at the ezgirl website.
2,Garden stand,I received the item faster than expected! Good quality for the money!Compliments to the seller for fast service!
2,Classic is BACK!,"Thank goodness they switched back to the old formula. What were they thinking. I stopped buying it a while back and my spouse bought some on accident. I was about to throw it away, but I hate to waste food. To my surprise it tasted good! They call it ""classic"" now. Some marketers ought to be fired over that one."
1,Horrible movie,This movie is horrible it should have a negative star rating. I rented it to compare to Edger Allen Poe's The Raven and it is so far on the cheesy side that it will not work for a comparison. Very bad start off and the whole movie is horrible.
2,Awesome,These are the greatest things in the world. At the prices on Amazon you can't loose. Definatly a good buy.
1,Why does this company sell junk?,It has been so frustrating to have containers like this that crack along the bottom and loose integrity after only a few uses. Which is better than the company that sells products like these: it doesn't have integrity to begin with.
1,Don't read this book if you really want to learn something!,"Ms Coulter may be a pretty blond (which she does her best to flount at her TV appearances) but her tongue and opinions are quite poisonous. I guess some people just hate President Clinton and there is probably nothing he could have done to change their opinions. I just don't see the high crimes committed by Clinton. Judging by our more recent experiences with another president (Mr. Bush), Clinton wasn't that bad. Leaving aside pre-determined attitudes, Ms Coulter really doesn't add much to our learning experience. If you want Clinton bashing (hating is a better word) you may enjoy the book but if you really want to learn something meaningful about Clinton presidency you won't get much out of this book. Ms Coulter plays the role of sensational story-teller relatively well."
2,"Great product, best at Amazon for the money","I purchased this for my grandson to take to college, it is great looking and very roomy. I especially like the zippered bottom with bottles included to keep shampoo, etc. My husband said this one was nicer that the one he had years ago when he entered the Army. If he doesn't lose it I know this will last him for many years to come. Do not hesitate to purchase this Dopp Jumbo kit, it is perfect, heavy duty zipper and carrying strap."
1,awful projection,"The projection on the ceiling does not work well. The last number has 3 parts that don't have light, so if it's 9:23 or 9:28, I can't tell the difference, I know it's nine twenty something, so it don't work for me, since I bought it for the projection feature."
1,Bad luck with this unit - do not recommend,"This unit started out well, I used it for jump starting the atv and lawn mower. It did not last long however. The fan started running all the time. This would wear down the battery. Keeping it plugged in all the time meant running the fan all the time. Eventually I unplugged it and left it for junk. I suggest you stay away from this one and this company."
1,Does not work!,"Save your money....this product is full of bugs and glitches. I encountered one problem after another attempting to get it installed and running on my fairly new loaded Dell PC (Pent IV, 356 memory, Windows ME, GeForce2 Ultra, CD-RW drive, & 40G HD with room to spare).Repeated email correspondence got the program running on my PC, but it is a confusing and glitchy program. After struggling with it for a week, I was still unable to produce a single functioning SDVD of home movies from my new digital camcorder.In the end, I returned to Amazon.com for refund."
1,NBA 2K2,"I was reading some of the reviews for this game and I was shocked at the results. This game does not even compare to NBA Live 02. The gameplay is very poor, as well as the player detail. In live, the players actually look like the players. I do not recommend this over NBA Live 02."
1,Not safe for use,I purchased a GoGo Walk Thru 30 inch 8 Panel Epoxy Exercise Pen. I have contracted customer service 2 times to ask if there were stabilizers to secure the pen otherwise (especially the side with the door) all of the side just wobble and is not safe for a dog. I was told no. I was also told that no one has ever complained about this defect in the product. I find that very hard to believe as it clearly is not safe for use the way it is. I would not recommend this product.
1,There's no ATI Mobility Radeon 7500,"Contrary to the technical data presented here, this product does NOT ship with ATI's Mobility Radeon 7500C video board. The video board is instead ATI's Radeon IGP 340M, which is based on an old Radeon technology (for a comparison between Mobility Radeon and Mobility Radeon 7500 see the site tomshardware.com). For those interested in playing new 3D games, this is a no-no. Besides that, the system comes with a poor selection of cheap softwares and games, which in the end eat up 7GB of your hard drive. The fan is also particularly loud and annoying. The only + goes to its sleek design."
2,Stays Fairly True to the Novel,"Given the two-hour time constraint, I felt this movie stayed quite true to the novel on which it is based, much more so than the recent Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley. The actors and their acting were also much more attuned to the time period in which the story takes place. I would recommend this film even to diehard Jane Austen fans."
1,junky,"My fiancee received this exact DVD player for Christmas. We have used it pretty regularly on the weekends since Christmas. After watching 2 dvds in one day, we tried to watch a third but kept getting the error message that ""no disc is being detected"". My fiancee called RCA and after waiting on hold for a half hour to talk to a customer service representative, they informed him that if he put out 50$, it would be fixed. I told him he might as well just buy another dvd player. I hope if anybody buys this make and model of dvd player, the same problem does not happen to you."
1,during the rare times that it does get the shot it is great...,"but 50% of the time it is very blurry. i bought this to go with my sony vaio (wonderful), but it has sent me running back to my old faithful- cannon- read all reviews and think seriously about whether or not you can take the chance of missing the shot (kids, wedding, vacations, et cetera). every once it a while the shot is outstanding, but more times than not...i'm very dissappointed."
1,NO CD ROM,"If your looking to explore the moon, this is the book to have. On the back cover of this book, it says a CD is included. Sadly this book doesn't come with a CD ROM. The book was returned to Amazon, then re ordered again with the same results. I want to view the JPEG photos on my monitor!"
2,A Lot of Fun,"I enjoy these types of publications. You really must read between the lines. What is the truth? Slanted, objective, subjective or whatever is what you get. Which way is up? It doesn't really matter. Consider the source and that's about all you can do. Enjoy it for what it is."
1,Does not produce hot coffee,"Bought this through Costco (love the return policy), and I'm glad I picked that store. It will be going back today.The machine seems to be decent quality, grinds well, and look nice at least to me.It cannot create a hot cup of coffee though - major flaw! The manual suggests heating up your cup first or doing another preheat cycle on the infuser (it already does this each time you turn the machine on). The manual also suggests not using a thin cup, as thick cups draw off too much heat. Call me picky but it is ridiculous to have to pick a special cup (I like my thick Starbucks cup), and why would I want to have to have to heat up my cup each time before using it? It also does not produce adequate steam; it's really just a stream of hot water. So latte's are out.So hopefully this review will stop a few people from ordering, and save them the hassle of returning it.I will be trying a Gaggia next."
1,This is Brutal,"Wing Commander is clearly the worst movie of 1999. I advise anyone who is even considering sitting through this mess to think it over before shelling out money for a rental. Aside from some laughably bad acting and totally flat story, even the special effects are embarassing considering this is a major Hollywood movie. Essentially, this film is a study in 'bad', and it succeeds on all levels. Awful. Drough!"
1,This is so bad its up there with William Hung's CDS!!,"My God this sucks, what the Hell was Blue Note thinking when this garbage was prepared for the RVG treatment? The music is like a bad Shaft sex scene, or some background filler for 70's pimps to put on; no, wait even pimps knew their music better than this dribble. I'd pay 2 cents for this if it were in that price range, but apparently some suckers have spent almost $20 on this nightmare; remember this is when Blue Note was sold and went completly down hill- (history) O, well. jb"
1,Horrible!,"I've never read a Star Wars book with so many continuity mistakes! What are the editors paid for? Certainly not for preventing mistakes. WJW practically ignored the 4 books that came out before DW!Some characters have been messed up so badly it hurt (Kyp, Jaina), the only one I liked in DW was Vergere, but they had to get rid of her, too, like they do with all the interesting characters.The Yuuzhan Vong intelligence is decreasing more with each book. When they were introduced as such powerful enemies I thought the people responsible for the NJO had a good idea of how they would still loose at the end, but unfortunately my expectations were too high, again.DelRey should get a new team for the SW novels..."
1,saw it not thrilled,"If you are looking for flight testing and areodynamic aspect of an airplane. You will be deeply disappointed. It was about instrumentation design and integration, that is it.Tony Wong"
1,Not so good.,"I'm not a big fan of the Beatles but I am a really big fan of remixes and I had to get this release and at least give it a try and see what the remixers have done to each of these very recognizable Beatles tracks. I have to say this is a really badly executed release. What were they thinking when they decided to go into the studio to create these tunes? They are just awful and really badly done. Anyway I can't even re-listen to any of the tracks because they just sound horrible. I really don't recommend it to anyone. If you need to buy it at least don't buy it new. Get it used in a bargain bin somewhere.SJ<a href=""http://www.bestplaylists.com"">Best Playlists</a>"
2,The Favorite Book,"My twin girls are 20 months old and have had this book since they were 10 months. This is still their favorite book. They are always coming to me with this book to read together. The photos are colorful and distinctive. They have learned the names of different animals, the sounds they make, the names of different body parts, and even songs. I have spent literally hours with this book and my daughters."
2,A Warrior for the Winter Season,"The Snowtroopers were one of the coolest characters (pun intended) in the Star Wars saga. Their appearance was brief, but still cool. These guys basically are Stormtroopers in winter apparel, and their purpose was to aid Darth Vader on Hoth.The toy is detailed nicely, coming with both a blaster/guy and a backpack. The figure itself also has some color variation. This of course is due to the snow and extreme temperatures, what else could it be from? This figure is for both collectors and those who want to send this guy right into battle. It is nice to see that Hasbro is reissued many of the old Star Wars figures. The Dark Side has never been chillier!"
2,The House of God: The Classic Novel of Life and Death in an American Hospital,"If you are a health-care professional who works or has worked at a large municipal inner-city teaching hospital, you'll feel that Shem was writing about your experiences. It's subtitle includes the wold ""classic."" It is just that among its countless ""cult"" followers. As the large municipal inner-city teaching hospital* fades away, it reminds one of the good and the bad of what was the norm from 1910-1970. It's a great gift to anyone who had listened to your stories over the years and is now working in one of the ""sterile"" versions of those old crucibles of the ""iron men"" (and women) of yore.*Think of MGH, Bellevue, Charity, Cook County, Grady, Parkland, etc., 40 years ago. If you're ""from"" one of them or somewhere similar, it's a must-read item."
2,"Best ""I'm-getting-older"" supplement","Every Doctor should be required to suggest Collagen supplements for older clients. This has done more to help with my hair (I have replaced lost hair), my skin (more elastic) and joint issues/pains...even wrinkles on my face such as 'crow's feet' at the corners of my eyes. I have since found another product though at Costco's that includes Collagen Type 2 and hyaluronic acid which completes the package. I don't know what condroiten and glucosamine really do but the results of this are evident."
1,surprised,I have to say that I was a bit surprised at the content of this movie. It should be sold as a porn product!
1,You can't judge a book by it's cover,"a) How many ""Moms"" do you know who make Cajun Macque Choux?b) I didn't find even one recipe that took only one dish to prepare.c) How many ""Moms"" use ingredients like saffron threads or capers on a regular basis?The title implies comfort food...don't be fooled. Just reading the book stressed me out because of the often hard to find ingredients and the numerous ""pots and pans"" needed to create even one recipe. Not even Martha Stewart would consider these ""comforting"" (as claimed on the cover) or ""one dish"" (as claimed in the title)."
2,"Quick, excellent service; the product was as expected.","Quick, excellent service; the product was as expected. Quick, excellent service; the product was as expected. (When will the submit button activate?)"
1,not happy with the quality,"I bought this seat cover to reduce the hardness of my original seat to my hybrid bicycle. After only two days of using this cover, the stitching began separating on the stretch material which goes around the perimeter of the seat. I returned the product for a credit ... not worth the price."
1,Entertaining but unreliable,"The book completely leaves out new evidence that places the ""invention"" of zero, together with the entire place-value system, to about 50 BC in India. I believe a paper to this effect was published in Mankind Quarterly in the early 90s and also in Indian Journal of History of Science in 1994 or 95 by the historian Subhash Kak. It is well known that zero was also known to the Babylonians and the Mayans, but its use in a proper place value system seems to have occurred first in India."
1,Disappointing Follow Up,"Looking for the original ""Balderdash"", I bought this game, thinking it must be as good or better. The original was one of the most fun games I've ever played, but this one, with its multiple categories, was a disappointment. The new categories, of movie titles, dates, acronyms, etc., somehow diluted the momentum of the original and missed the mark for creativity and hilarity that the was a consistant hallmark of its forbear. Playing the new version, we eventually only played the ""definitions of arcane words"" category. Anyone have a copy of the old version they're not using any more?"
2,Great cleanser,"Nothing more to say that this is a great cleanser. I have sensative skin, it works great for me. Doesn't strip skin of oils."
2,The Frankfurt Scholars and Bertolt Brecht.,"A very short observation: Every one that wants to explore the reasons of why Adorno and Brecht were water and oil, why Brecht was very interested in dialectical relationships between wave and matter or why Brecht never ended at Frankfurt receiving three naked students meanwhile a director, can't miss this book."
2,Puppy Loves It!,"My friend has this for her son, and her new puppy fell in love with it, so I thought I might try it for my new girl. So, I bought this for my 10 week old puppy - she just loves it. It took her a minute to get used to it, but now she'll go out of her way to run through it. So far its held up quite nicely to puppy chewing, running etc. What I really love is that is sooo easy to fold up. I can put it away in a minute and when she's ready to play I can just pop it open. So much fun - plus its big enough that she'll be able to play with it long into her growing stages. Very fun toy! Not sure if kids of the human variety enjoy it as much as the furry ones, but I recommend it if you have a playful puppy!"
1,Plastics are durable. Rubber parts only lasted 3 months,"The rubber parts only lasted 3 months, without new rubber parts no bubbles. I was expecting this pump to last at least a year or little longer, my old pump that was from a less expensive brand and lasted longer, the pump was pumping in the same place under the tank, subject to the same pressure.The plastic of this pump is very resistant, and somehow flexible, it may be a good idea to purchase a repair kit for this pump. However, 3 months is just to short, and the kit cost almost half what the pump cost. I decided to purchase Power Head instead."
2,Dorian Gray,"This movie is kinda hard to take, Dorian Gray is a tragic person that lost all for pleasure. The story was good but bad acting."
2,confy,"OK, this where what I wanted, soft and confortable for sleeping time, but with the pants.... they are too high, thus they show in the back...."
2,"Tough, gritty, excellent","Although Walter Hill may take some artistic license here and there, this is not a whitewashed version of these events. It is a pointed, tough, and very bloody depiction of the James-Younger gang, portrayed by four sets of real life actor brothers. The performances are uniformly excellent. Even Robert and Keith Carradine are impressive.Here the outlaws are presented as men of a peculiar honor, thieves and killers yes, but also dedicated family men who kill only upon necissity. Stacy Keach, as Frank James, particularly embodies this quasi-nobility.This film puts one in mind of Phil Kaufman's earlier THE GREAT NORTHFIELD MINNESOTA RAID, but Hill's version is grittier, bloodier, and more memorable."
1,"The Good, the Bad, and the Awful","Despite the title, this tape is actually 4 segments of approx. 1/2 hour each. Seg 1: Bloopers. Good shots, good narration, good soundtrack. Mostly college hockey clips. Worth watching. Seg 2: Fight and hits (not bloopers). Decent quality clips, narration, and music. Good hits. Worth a watch. Seg 3: Bloopers. Fair clips, stupid music. The narration will make you want to take your own life. Watch this segment only if bored, and PLEASE mute the moronic narrator. Seg 4: Bloopers. Fair to poor quality shots. Narration is poor, but not quite as annoying as Segment 3. Music is awful. As with Segment 3, if you watch it, I highly recommend watching it muted. You could easily skip this segment. Overall, it's probably worth getting for the first 2 segments, but realize you're only getting about 45 minutes of anything worth watching."
2,Excellent product.,"I needed something to secure my license plate that would make it a little harder for someone to ""borrow"" my plates without my permission. These locking fasteners worked perfectly."
2,Functional and sturdy,"I got the burgundy case, which in person is a little more burgundy and little less brown than the product picture displays on my screen (that's fine). The clasps all work just fine and it holds all of my keys without a problem, even when I have two on one clasp. I did find one of the clasps difficult to get open, probably from my fingers wearing out from the previous clasps, but I did get it open and my keys on there. All in all it's a great deal for the price."
2,"Fast, Incredibly Challenging Workout","I bought this DVD after I saw a rerun of her show on TV. I liked her tough training style and I thought I'd give it a try. It was worth every penny. It's just over 30 minutes and I was dripping sweat and barely able to finish. I'm in pretty good shape and normally lift heavy weights, but this workout was still tough. I think it's a reasonable amount of time and hits the muscle groups it needs to. I would recommend this to anyone, and told all of my friends to order it ASAP."
2,Great Player on par with higher priced products,"After having owned this DVD player for about a month...I feel that I have made a great choice.. This player comes with s-Video and RCA outputs.. as well as Component video outputs.. something you don't see on less expensive players. This player also has a optical digital out for connecting to a digital 5.1 reciever (yes.. you will need a full reciever, not just a 'ready' one).I find that the picture quality is superb, even using my yellow rca vidoe out on an old sharp 25"" tv... all the way up to a Proscan 32"" tv. Hookup is easy with NO hassles. Sound is excellent when simply hooked up to your tv.. but you will need a decent reciever to hear the 5.1 or DTS audio.. Remember.. the sound is only as good as the speakers / system you hook it up to... most small built in tv speakers just don't do DVD justice."
2,Still A Favorite,"Desperate Living is often an overlooked and forgotten piece of Waters' early work, mostly because of the abscence of Divine, but to me it's one of his best films which I continue to watch again and again. If you enjoyed Pink Flamingos, you need to get this as well as Female Trouble and Mondo Trasho (the later two can usually be found on e-bay or through some underground film distributors)and you will have the Waters essentials. If you're from Baltimore, I think you can appreciate his work more than an outsider would. Such sickness and deviation could only be born in Charm City. I originally saw this in Baltimore's Charles Theater (where many of his films have premiered) as a Saturday afternoon double feature with Multiple Maniacs (which I got there too late to see, caught it on video in later years). Waters was there to answer questions from the audience after the film(s) and I got to meet him in the lobby as well and shake the hand of ""The Prince Of Puke""."
2,pretty good,"This does a pretty good job of getting the juice out of the orange, lemon..... the only thing it doesn't do very well is keep the pulp out."
1,bad picture,"I saw this movie as a young child only once and thought it pretty scary. When I saw it was being released on DVD I was on the edge as to by it or not. I watched on HULUand thought the picture was worth getting.What I got was very muddy, not at all like what I saw. The distributor - Cheesy Ficks (?) must have gotten a very bad copy of a VHS to make this transfer.I will keep it because I want the film but I will get another copy with a better picture as soon as possible."
1,THE EDGE *not* anamorphic,"Despite what the specs on the back of the case say, THE EDGE is the same disc as the previous single disc release, i.e., 2:35:1 non-anamorphic. This is misleading and extremely disappointing. I picked this up at Circuit City thinking 20th Century had finally gotten their act together and given this outstanding film the presentation it deserved. I was wrong, now I'm stuck with a DVD I don't want that the store won't refund because it's open. Thanks, Fox Video, for overpaying some nitwit graphic artist who doesn't know what an anamorphic DVD is, and cheating me out of $10.00."
2,Another X-men hit,"This movie gave the backstory of Wolverine. I found it interesting and it answered some of the questions about how he came to be who he is. It has plenty of action, but also heart.However, to be honest, I like all the X-Men movies a lot so I may be prejudiced!"
2,Excellent account,This is an excellent account of a facinating subject. However a word of WARNING. Buy a hardcover copy as the binding on the paperback edition is the worst I have ever seen. It broke immediately. But I now have a HB copy for my library.
1,So Uncomfortable and must pay own shipping to return inferior product,"Our family adore the original design, without the dropdown seat. I cannot even find enough NEGATIVE superlatives to describe how uncomfortable this company's newly designed drop down pajama is. Do not buy them. you will only spend time repackagine, returning and paying to ship a product that should not be sold until they make them comforatable - as pajamas are to be."
1,Worst game ever!,"don't waste your money on a stupid game like this, graphics are average, fun facter sucks. I bought the game and it's a big rip off you are better off buying wwf raw or the smackdown games don't be like me and buy a sucky game. the moves suck and the gameplay is to damn slow. so don't buy this game."
1,"Lots of info, but poor explanations","I bought this book in October and have only finished it this May. I could only handle reading a page or so at a time because I found the style of this book awkward, stilted and difficult to follow. The 'conclusion' at the back of the book was particularly hard to read with the author evidently trying to impress the reader but failing to do so with me. The book also contained terminology and processes unique to the USA that was not explained such as GOP (which I found out through Yahoo is a reference to the Republican party) and 'auditor' elections. I still don't know what an auditor election is !There is no doubt there is good information in this book, but it lacks humour which makes it dry, and did not flow well. That's why I could only manage a page or so before having to put the book down for later on."
1,Scam,"In the listing it lists four types of Special K Cereal. But when you receive the order you get alot of different Kellogg's cereals. Like Mini Wheats, Granola with Raisins, Go Lean Crunch, these are not listed, only the Special K is listed. So if you want a varity than this is for you. But I wanted just the Special K and Smart Start as listed. So I feel I was Scammed with a misleading add."
1,"""Nice Voice- Awful Songs""","Easy to understand why she only had a couple hits, the songs here are awful, only 2 good ones worth listening to more than once.Downloaded the CD but after listening to all of it regret it as a waste of money. Unfortunate for now I'll never buy anything else by her."
1,"I felt, the audience of this book is author himself.","I am a perl beginner.I bought this book expecting lots of good Perl example codes which I can utilize at work.There are examples, thousand examples.Bad example vs Good exampleBut when I read more and more, Good examples (good perl coding habits) are good for himself.One of example I rememberHe mentioned about alignment, use 3(4?) spaces not use tab.He explained why.There must be good contents more in this book but ever since I went thru about his idea about spacing..I don't want to open the book now."
1,Total crap,"The support material sagged down so far that it touched the frame when I laid on it. The end pieces did not fit snugly and would fall off if the cot was bumped. Just a poorly put together item. With all the other positive reviews, I thought I made the right choice. Maybe this one just slipped past their quality control department somehow... Returning for a different manufacturer."
2,Great for nail biters!,"I bought this book because we have a couple of nail biters in this house and quite frankly, that makes me sick! Literally! This book goes into great detail on what is lurking under your fingernails, on your school desk, etc., and blows them up to indicate what actually makes us sick. This is one of those ""gross out"" books that boys LOVE! It is science at its best too - very fascinating and informative book. Did the job too - no more nail biting and no more strep throat! Highly, highly recommend!"
2,not for beginners,"This work is indeed good, but well, I had been out of kundalini practice for a while, and on the first try, I could not finish the routine; It supposes that you have already some base training and quite good stamina. To start a bit more gently, try Rodney Yee."
1,Horrible sound,"This is not a good phone. The functions are not pleasant to use and the sound is just horrible. There is a an echo, I even asked my husband sevaral time if he was listening to my conversation as it sounded like the second phone was also in use.I gave it two months and I am ready to bring it back!"
1,Piece of junk,"I purchased this broom from a big box store about 3-4 years ago and used it on a weekly basis to sweep up grass clippings after mowing - and that was it. First, I believe there was a cheap foam or plastic handle near that top that decided to fall off. Then last year as I was pushing a somewhat heavy pile of grass clippings, the shaft buckled and bent 1/4 of the way down from the top. I took a hacksaw to it to try and get more life out of it. Finally, today after pushing a light pile of clippings the shaft broke out of the yellow section that is connected to the broom. A cheaply made broom, for a cheap price is what you'll get here. My mistake was buying this broom on impulse for such a great price. As a professional horticulturist I should have known better. Now I'm going to spend triple the price and buy a Harper broom (which are made in the USA btw)."
1,Defective model,"dvd worked great,vhs was defective,found to have bad tape end sensors, im sure not all of them, but mine did. IF you get a bad one, just return it with your receipt and get another."
1,Background Music,"Frankly, I found this CD to play like a collection of B-Side tunes: Enjoyable background music consisting of mildly interesting pop-rock sound. However, nothing stands out to define this as an album, and there was a total absence of the melodic singles (including the overrated ""Vertigo"") for which U2 is so well known.Thankfully, Edge does shine through with some very skilled guitar, saving the CD from outright disaster.Highly anticipated, but disappointing effort from my favorite band."
2,very good game,"This is a very good game. It has great cheats and glitches. It's very challenging. I love the unique kinds of eggs, and the songs: awesome, fantastic and down-right cool."
2,The real thing,"Chris Stewart's book makes Peter Mayle's Provence efforts seem like puff fiction. Stewart's is about real poeple, while Mayle's seems to be written on the basis of market research (he's a PR man, after all).Stewart is a sheep shearer, and he's raising sheep on his finca. He interacts with his neighbors as a sheep farmer, and he tries to break into the business by passing the middle men. He learns his lessons and adapts, but it takes a lot of work and time.It's not a book for those who prefer the romantic tales about living simply in a rural Mediteranen environment. But it's a real story, told well and without pretense. Therefore it stays with you long after the other fluff has blown away."
1,horrible,this book was a waste of those hours of my life--just awful! I kept waiting for the plot to become interesting but it never happened.
1,Waste of paper it was printed on!,"It is just a day later after reading the book ""Master of Seduction"" and I can't even remember a lot of the plot anymore. It has no story at all! No tension, no romance, no action...just endless descriptions and blabber! Avoid at all costs!"
1,Bad customer service,Ordered this and canceled it within an hour of ordering and it was listed as not yet shipped but they shipped it anyway. Now I have to go through the hassle of waiting for it in the mail and then returning it. Very poor customer service.
2,Love It!!!...But.....,I think it's time for Stephanie to get some serious competition - in the love department. I'd love to see her FINALLY make up her mind about Ranger - only to have another character come in the picture and truly steal Rangers heart ...I think THAT would shake things up a bit. It would be more of a funny heartbreaker to have Ranger in love (have him meet his match - not hard like Joyce - sweet but[...])...have Stephanie go to Joe - only for Morelli to NOT take second place! HAHAHA I love the book and the characters though. It was a FAST read...and I'm already looking forward to 13...bit I DO agree that the Joe-Ranger thing has gone on too long.
1,Where's the 'Sci' part of the SciFi.,Boring. Very little science in this science fiction book. The reviewers on the back cover must not have read the same version of this book that I did.
2,A great introduction to Siddharta for kids,"Some of the hippy talk in the top reviews for this movie is a little unnerving to me. I plan to use this movie to give my daughters a good overview of the Siddhartha story when they're a little older. I liked it, and - since I saw it on television first - got through about half the movie before I recognized Keanu Reeves. I saw it first on television in Malaysia. To give you a thumbnail of the values system in a moderate Muslim country: Deep Blue, the shark movie, was run ""full blooded"" on television marked as ""suitable for all family members."" This movie was run with a ""Parental guidance - some ideas may be unsuitable for some family members."" disclaimer. No kidding."
2,Wonderful!,This is one of the best if not the best book that I have read. You can tell that Francine wrote the book right after becoming a Christian. The book may be fiction but the way is is written lets everyone know that God will always forgive you even if other people don't. It was a great inspiration to me. I have read all of her books I wish she had that many more to read. They lift your spirits.
2,DESCRIPTION BY THE AUTHOR,"The Amazon description for this paperback book is misleading. The author of the book is Kathryn Smith, the subject of the book is Rudolf (English spelling - Rudolph) Schindler. This is a capsule history of the famous house designed by Schindler as a double house for himself, his wife, and their friends, the Chaces in 1921 and built in 1922. It contains information about the design, construction, and the first years of history covering the 1920s. It is illustrated with black and white photographs and a well reproduced ground plan. This publication was a project of the Friends of the Schindler House, a non-profit, that owns the historic landmark property in West Hollywood. It was published on the occasion of the 100th anniversary, 1987, of the birth of the architect. This publication was printed in a small print run and is now out-of-print and rare."
2,Already done its job!,"Not 2 weeks after we received this and started using it, I noticed a stain right in the middle of the cover where the seat cushions are. It wiped right off, but if the cover had not been on it would have been on our newly reupholstered love seat. It fits very well over our rattan love seat. Very good quality cover, nice and heavy vinyl so it doesn't blow off and the velcro straps at the corners also help hold it on. We are very happy with this product. A++"
2,Works Great!,"This model (FF 140) is an entry level fish finder, but it does everything I need for a day of fishing. It has a very large read-out screen. The specs say the screen is 4"", but it is actually 4.7"" when measured diagonally (the way ALL screens are measured).I use it in the Harbor (saltwater) and in the local lakes (fresh water) and it has never failed to show me everything I need to know whether anchored, drifting or going 30 M.P.H.I highly recommend Garmin. I bought Garmin because I heard nothing but bad things about Hummingbird finders. I'm glad I bought Garmin."
2,revelations the demon slayer,it is a really good rpg it takes awhile to beat so you won't get that bored with the game really fast. You level up your guys you get monsters on your team it is really fun
1,So disappointed...,"This looks adorable in the picture. However, the fabric wasn't sturdy enough to use often and the fit is way off for a small."
1,"Be careful this ""DVD"" is 13 minutes long","I watched the 60 Minutes episode of ""Alone on the Wall"" when it aired and thought this DVD would have some other footage or coverage but to my dismay it really is just the 13 minute aired episode. The story still is pretty amazing if you haven't seen it but not worth the price for a 13 minute segment. There is also a National Geographic video on their website which is also called ""Alone on the Wall"" which documents Alex Honnold's story."
2,Great!,"Really good book. Great quotes, and a lot to reflect on. When I'm gonna leave this labyrinth? X x x"
2,John Badham's best.,"War Games was on in the days of the 70 mm craze of the 80's and was lavishly blown-up to the 70 mm screen. Still, except for the later DVD release, its previous film to video transfers (laserdisc included) were all subpar.I bought the latest DVD edition quite recently, but I did not hesitate to get the Blu-Ray disc as well, which is far better, picture and sound wise.War Games is an honest effort, a nice movie all around. With excellent performance of, and good chemistry between the two young actors. Their relationship is flirtatious, well humoured and meticulously directed.The film message is surprisingly up to date, and one hopes that it will eventually go through to the hearts and minds of those who are responsible for the state of constant war awareness that we are still living today."
1,Does Not Work,First off - A+ seller... got here in decent time... Product does not work at all... i have had no changes in my skin tone. luckily i didnt get any of the side effects either. Just won't purchase ever again :( i was really excited after reading reviews of european users... too bad didn't work at all for me. :( i would send back but it's not the sellers fault it's useless...
1,makes small cubes,"my biggest complaint with these trays is that they make tiny cubes, not 1oz cubes as they claim. it's turned into a game in our house -- how many cubes will it take to make 5oz? 8? 9? it's inconsistent and hard to measure how much my baby is eating. i'll probably buy different trays soon and get rid of these."
2,Raven!!!! This bands kills all the others w/ Sheer Power!!!,"I have known about this band since they came onto the scene in 1981. NWOBHM RULES!. I saw them live every single time they came anywhere within 3 states of where I live in Maryland. They are amazing live and the new album ""ONE FOR ALL"" reminds me of them in the hayday of Crash, Bang, Wallop and Wiped out... I remember they were so nuts on stage (the brothers, Gallagher) use to run at opposite end of the stage and smash into each other while playing and never missed a note. If any one wants to chat or drop me a line on Raven, feel free.... Or if you have any bootlegs and want to trade let me know.... LIVE AT THE INFERNO, FOREVER!!!!!!"
2,Excelente reloj!,"Es un reloj fantastico tal cual se puede observar en su descripción. Es bastante deportivo y completo para personas que por ejemplo, quieran cronometrar sus ejercicios. Tiene tres alarmas, uno uso como despertador, y las otras dos para marcar dos horarios del dia. Los marcadores del reloj brillan en la oscuridad, y tambien se puede encender la luz, pero esta luz no alumbra la pantalla (esto sabia por que antes de comprar leí las otras descripciones del producto, pero de igual manera me compré). Sinceramente, la mejor relación precio/calidad."
2,An excellent introduction to philosophy.,"I found this book to be an excellent introduction to Philosophy. I have seen the many reviews critical of this book and they have inspired me to go ahead and buy the ""Idiots Guide To Philosophy"". However, I do not regret buying the ""Dummies"" version. A very entertaining book. I will continue my journey with the ""Idiots"" version to see what all the fuss is about."
2,GREAT PRODUCT!! CAME 5 DAYS EARLY!!,Great product I could not be happier!! works wonders to keep my lap top cool!!
2,Number 1,"This is one of the best CD's I've ever purchased! This band rocks!!!! And there isn't a single dud on this one, they're all good... I'm surprised this is an Import, this one's too good. I would rate this CD in my top 5 all time favorite CDs."
1,cheap,This phone feels & looks cheap. I have not found this phone to user friendly either. It was not worth the amount of money I paid for it.
2,"The best after ""Alien"" (1979).","I think this film is the best after the first ""Alien"". Great acting, good story, great action sequences, great special effects and new fresh character like Ryder. Excellent."
1,BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I actually watched this movie, until I could not take it any more. I am a big fan of indy budget horror, and trust me this is the worst FILM ever made. They have no talent, they look like dropouts from a school full of losers. I can't believe anyone would follow this CRAP. I REPEAT this is the worst movie ever made. NO script, not funny, directing non existent. Anyone who watches this drivel is either below the age of 21 and has no brain cells left in their brain. Or an IQ of a rock!!! STAY VERY FAR AWAY!!"
2,very solid album,"I was very pleased with the album right away; ""Megalomaniac"" is an excellent track, and everything that follows is really good. I believe the album fizzles just a little toward the mid-end, but finishes strong with the last two tracks. All in all, this is a very good album, though."
2,great read,"I loved Anthony Bourdain before reading this, as I am a big fan of his show(s) and him in general as a critic and unapologetic ""personality"". So this book instilled even more how much I appreciate his style, his humility (yes, his humility) and how good of a writer he really is. In addition, it served as a helpful guide to dining out in NYC and just the things one should know in general about the restaurant industry. I loved how his ""voice"" came across in an approachable behind the scenes look at what it's really like to try to be a chef in one of the toughest (if not THE toughest) places on earth. I feel like anyone wanting to be a chef, especially in NYC should read this as it will take them down to reality of what you will really encounter day in day out. However, I still really enjoyed the book just as an onlooker, not someone in the industry but appreciating those in it and the work that they do-so anyone who loves food and eating out would find this a really great read as well."
2,Great writing practicum at your fingertips,This book is extremely informative and convenient for the aspiring journalist who desires to break in the competitive industry of tv news. The material is comprehensive and effective. Students and professionals can benefit from the demanding exercises this amazing text offers.
2,Tight,"Excellent novel, full of disjointed short stories, that really drive home the squalor and misery of modern, suburban life. It's a very blatant book, full of entertaining situations and disgusting parts that will make ye retch (some involve bodily secretions, let's leave it at that), but also, there's subtlety at work behind all that; Welsh does not make his work sensational and doesn't overstate what he's saying, which is a blinkin' good quality, in mine opinion. Read this. It's a tad better than the excellence of its film."
1,this is worse than horrible. this is trash.,"i recently bought my first dvd player. my neighbors knew this, so they gave me this dvd for christmas, knowing my appreciation for john lennon. i'll never tell the neighbors, but this thing is horrible. i was shocked by how bad it was. the liner notes do not match the content. the longest section shows m.d.c. detailing the events of that night. who wants that? kate millet then tries to fill us in on lennon's death... wait a minute. i don't know WHAT she was talking about.this whole thing is hideous. this is bad. you do not want to own this. this is embarrassing. now....what do i tell the neighors?"
2,Waltons Irish Whistle,"I really have not found a difference in the various companies that offer the Irish Tin Whistle. Price doesn't seem to matter much in making your choice. They still all sound the same. Difficult little instruments to master (I'm still working on it). Since they are so inexpensive, try one of each and see if you like the sound of one more than the other. Then, if you find yourself researching further you will have an idea of what the various name brands represent. Or, check with a music master before buying. That certainly isn't me. Otherwise, just buy the Walton and enjoy it."
2,I Like this book! It's Pretty Good For Programmers.,"During the time I started out using the Basic Stamp, I evenually got started programming PIC's.Knowledge of Hex and Binary numbers will help you along as the author explains the different registers associated programming the 16F84.This thing about backwards compatibility using instructions which prepare you for using the 16C54,which the author likes to use,is basically a shortcut. I didn't like it at first, but as you near the end of the book,everthing is explained in plain english. David benson wrote these books(I have the complete set from SQUARE 1) with the intention of keeping the reader interested, and certainly has done it well. If your like me, and a hardcore programmer at work, I welcome you to try this book and learn the easy way......I did!"
2,"Beautiful, simply beautiful","I had purchased this CD in a used bin from my local record store more than six years ago. I had heard a brief news story on this CD from CNN, and I decided to take a chance on this ... bargain.Boy, did I ever make the right call. I knew almost next to nothing about George Gershwin, but the music on this CD was simply too magical. All the familiar melodies and song I had heard one time or another in my life (like the United Airlines commercial from ""Rhapsody in Blue"") jumped right from my boombox. You can feel Gershwin's energy and intensity in each and every one of these songs, and there were times that I would be swept away in excitement by the speed and emotions.I know I did a poor job in describing this CD, but I can guarantee you that if you like piano melodies, this CD should definitely belong in your collection. After all these years, it is still one of my favorites."
1,"Lame, Lame and more lame","Silly little predictable movie, I cant even say it was amusing. It was so dumb. I liked all the cast and the acting was fine it was the silly story that was so horrible.Save your money folks and watch a Gilligans Island rerun."
2,Great card for linking to PC a network,I just happened to have the Trendnet router. This installation was fast and clean. It connected immediately and connects whenever I boot up. This worked perfectly for me. I understand there may be compatibility issues between routers and cards if they are not the same brand. If you have a Trendnet router (they're excellent) then this is the PC card for you. It may work well with other routers but I don't know about that.
2,"""Repulsive""?---NOT!!!!","OK This is one of my favorite action movies, and I find it hard to see how that reviewer found it ""repulsive"". I remember waking up in the middle of the night and flipping channels and finding this movie. I had already missed the beginning, but it drew me right in and I ended up watching the rest of it. The next morning I was online trying to find it because I had no idea what the name was. I found it today on Amazon and the price cannot be beat! If you haven't seen this yet, give it a chance-Geena Davis is terrific!"
2,An excellent book!,This is a great book for anyone interested in learning about jade. The color photos are excellent and really show the beauty of the fascinating stone.
2,Great Read; Great Tool,"This 384-page almanac is chocked full of articles with daily info on moon phases and other needed info. I like the listing of the days instead of trying to cram all the info into a calendar form. The articles or chapters, are all well written and can be read within a half hour for most so it is easy to pick this book up, pick a spot within the book and just read. You don't need to start on page 1 and probably shouldn't! I'm now going to look for 2006 just to read all the articles."
1,Disappointing,"""Anubis Gates"" is on of my favourite books, and I love the way Powers can weave a myriad of obscure (and not so obscure references) to create bizarre stories that somehow ring true. This, unfortunately, is not one of his better ones. Yes, it's quite possible to get all the references in this book and still not enjoy it; it feels leaden, and there's no real fun in it, and sheer bloodymindness is the only thing making me finish it."
2,A great book,"I have read many books on goal setting/attainment and this is one of the best. The author says that one day he sat down and made a list of goals, like most other books say to do. The problem was that the list didn't really motivate him -- so he invented a way to make his goals come alive by making them into future ""memories"" and thereby adding emotional ""zing"" to them. I think his approach is terrific and highly recommend this book."
2,Genius and Confusion,"F. Scott Fitzgerald's timeless classic of the Gilded Age, The Great Gatsby is the tale of Jimmy Gatz, and his desire to achieve status in the upper class. His love for Daisy Buchanan is his only guiding star, but Daisy has married another. Narrated by Nick Carraway, this book takes the reader on a whirlwind journey through the aristocracy of America.I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It has a lot of literary genius, but it does get a bit confusing at times; the humour more than makes up for it, though. It's a relatively short book, and you have to read it all in one go, or you'll lose track of characters. All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone--except kids."
1,upset,ok.. so i got the cd and i have a windows vista. and the cd will not play in my laptop.. upset.. LOVE the movie but upset that the cd will not play
1,Not completely satisfied,"The phone itself was a great phone,it will teach my son numbers,objects and noises except for the fact that he can't hear anything.At the store the phone worked great but when you take it out of the box the volume completely goes down and you can barely hear a word elmo says.I was not very happy along with a few other friends for this was my sons favorite new toys.I've tried new batteries and it still does not work."
1,I like three songs,"Maybe I should have listened to the CD more? I just couldn't get into this albums rhythm. Some songs were boring or just drawn out with annoying bellowing. I felt like the growth was forced, and the album might have been rushed. I suggest legally downloading the tracks you like. His first album was miles ahead of his second and third. I suggest that, MOS, commits to making a quality album while only concentrating on the music and not the movies."
1,kitty pad,well i got this for a outside cat. Plugged it inside first and it barely got warm( more like on the bottom). took it outside and put it in a tub and it never even got warm enough to attract the cat to stay on it. So for my benefit i donated the money on this one. Not good for what it claimed for me anyway.This was put in a shed so it wasnt out side in the weather. When i got it the weather was chilly but not cold. The cats do better on their own snugglin up in the hay.
2,The amazing cable!,"I can't believe how information can be sent through this amazing cable! Works also as a leash for my humming bird but he gets mad when I make him wear it! At least I think he's a male, could be female but not sure."
2,"excellent book, short chapters and easily read","Using references and examples from history, the author clearly identifies and analyses 33 laws of success. In doing so he is able to make clear how the reader is best able to incorporate this knowledge to ones own best interest. At the begining of the book is a guide to use the book to its fullest, and at the end of each chapter is space in which one may follow the instructions. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to better ones life, and I personnally am a repeat reader of it"
1,disappointed,"I purchased this chair/stool for my wife for Christmas, after an extended assembly, the item will serve it's intended purpose, but very disappointed in quality, the backrest & seat have areas that are completely worn thru the covering in shipping, poorly packed for transit from CHINA.. would not recommend this product to any one and will think twice about further purchases online..Cosco 11120RED1 Retro Chair/Step Stool, Red"
2,Wonderful but rare video,I saw this in 1992 and it is a beautiful production. I only wish I could find it in a digital format!
2,Good Book.,"When I recieved this book I was really intimidated, I don't like biographies very much, especially not HUGE ones like that! But I love CS Lewis, and it turned out to be a great book!"
2,A Good Game...but not a lot to do,"This game is pretty fun. You can pick your rider's clothes and hair and your horse's coat, mane, saddle and pad. You can also name the rider and horse.You can ride in the practice corral (which is totally easy and you can be a pro once you play it a few times), ride in a pasture (this is not quite so easy, you have to finish the courses within a few seconds. I'm not even past the second one yet!) Then you can ride in a competition. In the practice corral and pasture, there are arrows in the ground to follow, and in the competition there aren't any arrows, but there's a path that you follow and it's very easy--easy enough that the first few competitions I was in I won first and second place. The pictures and awards you got you can view them in the Scrapbook and print them out. There isn't a lot to do, but still I find this game fun."
1,The Print is way to small,The pop up window that displays the text is misleading. The type is much smaller than it appears on screen. Reading these bibles was difficult even for the folks with 20/20 vision.
1,Rip off,"This bar is usless without the boots. The bar accessory is displayed WITH boots, leading you to believe you are getting both items. Very disceptive advertising. I would sent the bar back, however, to do so would cost more then the bar is worth. IT IS A BIG FAT RIP OFF. Amazon, you were cunning and most deceptive, also allowing the seller to be, with this item. I am disgusted."
1,Only the sheep get digital copy...,"- Digital Copy of the film you can watch anytime, anywhereOnly through iTunes. Not good if you have an android device or choose not to have anything to do with iTunes.Is this a new trend? I have other Paramount digital copies that work on any device, why did they restrict this release to only support iTunes?FAIL!"
1,Monster/ISF HDTV Calibration Wizard DVD,"This was not all the helpful. After changing my settings to what this DVD recommended, the picture on my TV was worse than before I started. I did learn what the different settings were all about and how to use them, but I found the settings per the DVD were way off. At least the price I paid for the DVD wasn't too bad."
1,Campaigns ONLY,"I bought this book with the starcraft battle chest and I must say that this book is not very good. It is okay to use it for campaigns, but for custom games, it's horrible. Either the strategies are to basic, or they don't work. You'll find your self saying ""Wow, thank you captin obvious."" If you like to play capaigns, then you may want this book because it helps you a little bit. If you're like me and like to play custom games or have little intrests in campaigns, look elsewhere."
1,Did not need this,"Came free with huge hard drive. Don't feel I should have to waste fourteen more words, handicapped as I am satisfying your review parameters."
2,Loved it!,This product does just everything it promises! Great file! Plus the case makes it practical to have it with you inside your purse all the time :)
2,Chi seeds,"Dr Coates has been inttrumental in bring more information about the chia seed. It has long been underground, maybe soon it will become a source of food for hungry people and a source of vital nutrition and health for everyone. Our bodies ned it. At this time some chia is out on the market but a lot of it is not good quality. Doctor Coates does support one type of chia seed made by Lifemax. Check out www.allswell.lifemax.net for more info about the highest quality chia seeds supported by Dr Coates."
1,a how-to book with step by instructions and exercises,"I did not finish the book - it is more like a 'workbook' than a book. I was hoping to get some insight into how to deal with people in the workplace - this book is full of material that I consider to be common sense. Little emperical or formal evidence is offered.I suggest 'The Secret Handshake' by Kathleen Kelley Reardon for readers interested in improving their polical skills in a business setting.That's my take - loopster - Chicago, IL"
2,a real classic,I used this book back when I was in highschool in the 80s and had to buy it again to refresh myself. Its a real classic. It has all the great myths. Each one is short and sweet so you can read through the myths you might be wondering about without having to read through long myth stories. The writing style is accessible and colorful. Definitely and enjoyable read.
2,Makita 14.4V Cordless Drill Set,"I just graduated from a Makita 7.9V to the 14.4V and am completely impressed with the difference. This drill has good balance and feel. It delivers plenty of torque and has a consistent drive force when installing 2 1/2 inch deck screws. The torque adjustment handles 1 1/4 inch screws equally as well and without breaking any. A bonus is the smart charger that accepts all Makita batteries from 7.9V to 14.4V. It has features (LED) that tells the battery condition, charging rate, etc. I highly recommend this kit.I would have given the drill a 5 star rating except for the fact that is is new and I've only finished one project. However, if this drill, batteries and charger lasts as well as the other Makita products I currently own, I do not expect any problems. Thanks to Amazon for the great service!"
2,Great book,"Read this book years ago beginning of college years, find myself reading it again and still love it! Inspirational, helpful, easy read"
1,Simply doesn't work,"I'm not a high-maintenance customer--I routinely buy and enjoy products that have mixed reviews. But this is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. Simply put, the alarm doesn't work. Sometimes it vibrates when wet. Sometimes it vibrates when dry. Sometimes it turns itself on and off randomly. The sounds don't seem to work. Other people seem to have better luck, so maybe I just got a bad one, but it feels plasticky and cheap, so I suspect yours may be as bad as mine was."
2,"""Chocolate Thoughts:......""","Ladies! If you want to know some of the things that go on in a man's (particulary a Black Man's) head check it out. I wasn't able to put it down. I was also very surprised about some things, I bet you would be too. Sooo, check it out!"
2,Awesome Mattress!,"We have slept on this mattress for a week now and no more backaches! My husband and I were used to getting up 4-5 times a night and then feeling very tired in the morning, we are now sleeping through the night and both feel rested when morning comes. It is a awesome mattress! We received the mattress in 3 days after we ordered it. It took 1 1/2 hours for the mattress to take its shape. The chemical smell was strong so we have left the covers off during the day so the smell could escape and that has helped so now that we can barely detect it I am now ready to make the bed everyday! We almost bought a Tempur-pedic mattress but we are happy we chose this mattress as we like this one so much better for the price! You will not go wrong purchasing this mattress, you will love it!"
2,"Seven Little Foys, a serious Bob Hope","When I first saw this movie I was somewhat surprised at the more serious tone of Hope's part. However, once I got past that point I enjoyed the movie for what it was, a terrific look at one of America's great vaudeville performers, Eddie Foy. While Hope wasn't his constant comical self, his interplay with his children, who had some of the better lines to Hope's straight man part, both on and off stage, were great fun. The other high point of the film was James Cagney's role as George M. Cohan, one he made famous earlier in Yankee Doodle Dandy. The constant one upmanship between the two and their table top dance routine were the high point of the film. If you like Bob Hope, you'll enjoy this movie."
2,Very informative,"Mr Copp's book is a must for any serious student on Normandy, and the Canadian contribution. While it helps to have an understanding of the Commonwealth campaign in Normandy, it is not required. I enjoyed Mr. Copp's unique ""Canadian"" look at much facts and criticisms leveled at the Canadian Forces. I feel that Mr. Copp brilliantly dispelled many of the facts that have seen as truths of the campaign. A great read for a student of Normandy, Canada, and the War."
2,Simply Outstanding!,"The title of this review says it all. John pulled off another masterpiece that is a tribute to Roger Zelanzy -- Amber Series.His description of Chaos is just short of amazing. I enjoyed the continued unfolding of the plots and how Oberon, the Jewel of Judgement and so much more fits in all this. I can't say more without giving anything away.Enjoy.MoonDragon of SoA"
1,"Haven't bought it, wouldn't buy it","Very simply - no matter how beautiful a voice he has, I want to hear songs that I understand. Why can't he do a CD totally in English?"
1,Long and drawn out,This book is more of a yearbook of the victims than it is an account of the crimes or the mind of the GRK. It just went on and on about each girl and her miserable life and how that led her into the world of prostitution and eventually to becoming a GRK victim. I read about 3/4 of the book and then just gave up. It just went on and on and on and jumped all over the place. Only Ann Rule book I did not enjoy. And the first book I have ever not bothered to finish reading.
1,Workbook/Lab Manual Vol. 1 to accompany Que tal?,Very skimpy little pre-released manual of actual Workbook. Don't buy this unless you think you want to save money when in fact you'll lose money if you don't buy the real workbook.
1,Not a NATURAL product,"I should have asked my family to buy and or look at these products in the pet store, but they weren't home...since I am disabled and can't go out--I rely on amazon and reviews.I should have double checked first before springing for this obvious chemical spray. there's a LOT of warning labels on proper disposals and calling waste management. if this WERE a true natural product, why the warning labels?I am disappointed by this ""natural"" spray. I won't buy this stuff ever again.oh worst part is, the packages kept leaking like crazy, making it all the more difficult to use. if I want a more natural product, I am going to do some more thorough research next time out. I won't be killing my babies with chemicals."
1,"Okay, but not scary","I thought from the reviews that this movie would be better than it was. It looks like a movie that was made for the Sci Fi Channel. It's okay if your flipping through channels for something to watch, but I wouldn't spend money on it. It's not scary or even tense. I think the person who wrote wow must have been in the movie or had a friend in it. I don't see anyway anyone could watch this movie and say wow. I try to see every horror film I can. I don't scare very easy, but I don't think even a child would be scared by this one."
2,Great product,"I have been using this pan for several weeks now and is easy to use, easy to clean (not in dishwasher). Heats up evenly. Can fix a whole meal at one time."
2,Awesome Book,If you want to learn how behavioral intervention is really practiced to really help children with disabilities; this is the book for you. The behavior technology described and examples of interventions given can be applied with modifications to anyone or anything that is capable of learning.
2,For the Grown and Sexy!,"This cd is sooo nice...the first cut ""Put me On"" is my favorite. It sounds like funk w/ a hint of jazz. I love his style of music, even his Luther remake of ""Superstar"" is done in excellent taste."
2,Masterpiece,Man this is the one The classic that never stops. I still hear this album playing till this day. Keith Sweat is the man.
2,Very nice finish,This paper holder provides a bit of a modern look to my bathroom. It's easy installation will make any novice feel like a pro.
2,Remove yer brain... it's Laymon!,"When I see a book on the shelf by Laymon, whether it be new orused, I feel like a gunfighter in a spaghetti western... I can herethe theme for ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly""... In my mind, that best describes the books of Richard Laymon... I consider ""One Rainy Night"" to be one of the ""good"". The story goes from 0 to 60 from page one and somehow, keeps going full bore for 416 pages! Doesn't seem that long, but it is... Blood and guts, sex and rape, it's all here in typical Laymon fashion... a B-novel that's a definite no- brainer! And despite it's flaws (weak characters, poor dialogue...), it's perversely enjoyable! Though I do agree with the reviewer who recommended ""The Fog"" by James Herbert, it truly is a classic!"
1,......DISGUSTING AND A WASTE OF MONEY,"Well, I wish I had read some of the reviews here before I wasted my money. The hero is a dispassionate old lecher who decided to prove to an 18-year-old girl that he loved her by raping her. I didn't even make it to the gang rape or the adultery. Don't I feel like a silly goose. Who ever told Ms. Coulter that rape was the ""perfect"" tool of courtship should be, well, something! I mean really, if rape is your thing, who am I to quibble but they should really give a hint on the jacket or something, you know, a word to the wise, a wink and nod and I would just walk on by for pity's sake. I don't need this sort of filth ruining a romantic mood."
1,Very cool looking,"These subs look amazing and with neon lights they really get your friends attention. However, if your looking for loud or clean bass then forget these subs. The enclosure rattles and although it says its MDF, im pretty sure its particle board. The subs are not polypropylene like advertised. The cone appears to be paper with a hard plastic like coating. It might be polypropylene coated but underneath its paper. I love how these subs look but replaced them with louder and better sounding subs. They are very inefficient as well. They take 250-300w rms but sound like 100w rms or less subs"
1,Does not last!,"This toy appears to be good quality and is easy to use and my little boy enjoyed it until it stopped working...within less then a year of occasional use. Changing out the batteries did not prove to be helpful. It simply ""gave up the ghost"" and was ready for the trash bin. Very disappointing."
1,outrageous,"Don't waste your money. More than half of this little paperback book is exercises. I was astounded to find a little card in the book asking me to send $3.50 to obtain the answers to the exercises!! After paying $20.00 for a book that is clearly overpriced. If you want a textbook, look at one of the many others that are better and have better prices -- and include the exercise answers."
2,100% Based on the Professional Association of Resume Writers,"Complete instructions on impact cover letter and resume writing as well as acing an interview- this is the focus of this book. That's why if you are looking for a book which describes the life onboard and contains stories of people who have worked on a cruise ship my recommendation is ""Working on Cruise Ship"" or ""How to get a job with a Cruise line and travel around the world"".Actually I wanted both- complete, step-by-step, professional-grade instructions, which I found in ""Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days"" and a lot of personal stories as well as lighter and humorous approach, which I found in ""Working on Cruise Ship"" and ""How to get a job with a Cruise line and travel around the world"". That's why if you are looking for both sides consider these perfect matches."
2,Lovingly Told,"I have been reading about Marilyn Monroe since I was 12 years old, way back in 1978, and this book is a perfect companion piece to any Marilyn fan. For once there is no harping on the Kennedy connection - not that I mind books that do this - it's just that this book doesn't go down the familiar conspiracy route. Instead it is full of loving anecdotes from the people surrounding Marilyn in the last months of her life. There are also little, perhaps unknown, details that emerge, like the fate of Maf-Honey after Marilyn's death as well as truely touching mentions of Joe DiMaggio and Joe Junior's deep love for Marilyn that brought tears to my eyes. The details of Marilyn's house are well researched and presented and include many illustrations and photos of artworks and furniture that Marilyn purchased in the last months of her life. I just so wish things had ended better for her; that she could have enjoyed some peace and serenity in her modest bungalow."
2,There is no picture of the Macro-Crystalline Glazes: The Ch,"My name is Peter Ilsley also. I was tracing the web pages of the name and found this web site.I was astonished to find that you were selling Macro-Crystalline Glazes: The Challenge Of Crystals without showing any pictures of it or telling anything about it. ""image not available.""Please show a picture of the Macro-Crystalline Glazes: The Challenge Of Crystals."
1,I can pass,"I could pass for this CD, for their pitch sometimes is a little off, and the drums sometimes take power over the voice of the band. The lyrics seem to be pretty good, but I tell you, listen to the samples of their songs before purchasing their CD. Most bands could do better...Let's take their age into consideration. The drummer girl is pretty good at drumming for a 10 year old, and the singer is alright for a 13 year old, except I have a friend who recently turned 10, (young, right?), and SHE sings better than SMOOSH. Instead of listening to the singing, how about making a CD with only the drum music on it, and not the terrible squealing that people consider singing. Please, take what I'm telling you here into consideration, and just listen to the downloads and don't purchase this CD."
2,Happy,This product is very good and I am happy with my purchase. The delivery was like WOW. It was really fast.
2,Cuts wood like butter,"I was considering buying the Bosch model, but I ended up buying this one instead. I already owned a Milwaukee circular saw and was extremely happy with it (I own a Bosch router and am happy with it as well). I saw the 5 star ratings on this saw and decided to buy it instead of the Bosch. I've got to admit, it deserves the 5 stars given by everyone else up to this point. The tooless blade change is great as is the case. Most importantly, the saw is smooth with no vibration. For a jig saw, it cuts very smooth."
1,Join the boycott,"This is pretty brazen for New Line to try to rip off the fans like this. Maybe they thought nobody would notice? I'm sure they'll sell some copies, especially to the Walmart crowds. But what good does it do them if their core fan base is pissed off?"
2,Great read,"To Lois Lane, et. all:How would you have written this biography, sans the quotes from the people who knew him best? The form inherently lends itself to this technique, as any journalist will assure you.The comparison between Evanier and McCullough is irrelevant. They are two completely different animals.Glad I didn't take your misguided attempt at egalitarianism for gospel. I would've missed a great book, one I highly recommend to other Darin fans."
2,great collection and service!,great collection and great service! would recommend this product to anyone. service was great and received the product sooner than expected
2,impressed,"I was so impressed with this product I have purchased two more sets for gifts to family members but I do recommend a ceramic knife sharpener for when they show signs of dulling, a couple of pulls through the sharpener and they work like new again"
1,Cheap,I bought these to use while I am jogging and what a mistake that was. I used them once and then bought something else. The ear loops did not secure the headphones at all. The left ear kept falling off and eventually I took them off from annoyance. The sound was god awful as well. It was like listening to your neighbor's static-y TV through an apartment wall. Try jogging with a gramaphone if you want comparible quality and comfort. Avoid these unless you are stationary and hard of hearing.
1,The Weakest Koontz Novel I have Read,"I love Dean Koontz, and recommend many of his novels without reservation. THE MASK, however, is pretty bad. It's slow paced and lacks the fine character development that Koontz displays in his later work. The two main leads are ""goody two shoe"" type characters and possess almost no flaws. I didn't find them particularly believable or interesting.The final 50 pages of THE MASK are relatively action-packed, but you have to slow through 250 pages of boring setup to reach that excitement. The ending is limp and inconclusive, which made me feel like the whole book was a waste of time. This was one of those stories where I felt the underlying concept had enormous potential, but the execution was lacking.THE MASK was an early Koontz novel, written in 1980 under the name Owen West. My advice is to skip this minor effort, and focus on Koontz' stronger work, such as PHANTOMS, WATCHERS, LIGHTNING, INTENSITY and ODD THOMAS."
1,bad bad bad,This was my second water slide and it lasted about a month being very careful with it and following all instuctions it still riped down the side the same as the first one I bought. You will not get a replacement or your money back even if you buy the 2 year warenty . I just want everyone to know what you are getting into when you buy this product I personally dont know anyone who has purchased a banzai slide that has lasted more than one summer.
2,Loved it,Great book couldn't put it down. As always funny and thrilling and romantic at the same time I just love these books
1,An Obvious Crowd-Pleaser,"I saw this piece of work in the theaters, and at the time I thought it was okay. Seeing it for the second time here made me reconsider. This movie blows. Sure, there's plenty of action, and little else. Will Smith plays a fighter pilot, Jeff Goldblum a computer expert, and Bill Pullman plays the President in this film. This movie, in which aliens invade the Earth, cannot be called science fiction. Science fiction is Star Wars, 2001, and Starship Troopers. This movie does do exactly what it set out to do. The special effects are incredible, the sound is extremely good, the alien ships do look, alien. On the other hand, the aliens themselves are laughable, as is the ""plot"", which should make comic-book writers shudder. Pancake characters round out this film that was so successful the first time they are selling it again so that the company can get more cash to make more movies like this. So if you want an post-lobotomy action movie, you've come to the right place."
1,confusing,"Was difficult to digest or enjoy, too much redundancy and talk, excercises do not have answers and really did not make me absorb the subject."
2,CRIB CD PLAYER USEFUL,THE CRIB CD PLAYER IS VERSITILE IN THE SENSE THAT I CAN PUT IT ON MY BABIES BASINNETT OR CRIB. I'M ABLE TO PLAY MY BABIES LALABY CD'S IN IT.
1,Rock music is dead.,"I can't listen to mainstream rock anymore and these guys are to blame. Everything sounds the same - I don't know if these guys are trying to sound like everyone else, or if everyone else is trying to sound like them. Either way, it just makes me want to throw my radio out the window and learn to play music myself. Anyone with any musical aptitude can write and perform better than this drivel."
1,Piece of junk,High price piece of junk. Failed completely after only 5 days of operation. Displays code F70. Have to send to Panasonic for repair already. Seller would not exchange for new unit because I had it for more than one week. Their return policy is only for one week!! Beware of sellers who do not disclose their return policies. I paid [$$]. with no shipping charge. Panasonic refused to supply a new unit. Will not buy any Panasonic products in the future. I rate it zero stars!!!
2,Easy to use,"I've been using this in my daughter's room for a few nights now and am glad I purchased it. It was very easy to set up and figure out how to use it right out of the box.I don't find the glow to be too bright for her room - there is a button to adjust the brightness and on low I think it's just fine.I like the variety of sound options to choose from - one night we'll listen to white noise, the next night rain, the next night the ocean waves. I think all of them sound fairly realistic and I like that you can adjust the volume of the noise to the level you want.I would recommend this purchase -for the price I think it's a very good buy."
1,Too dated and if you have a decent manual you don't need this book.,"The first 8 chapters of this book are in your owners manual. Chapter 1 (what is a serger), Chapter 2 (which one to buy), Chapter 3 (thread and threading), Chapter 4 (cutting your pattern) chapter 5-8(curved seams,securing ends, sewing order and, tension balance) all already in my manual. Chapters 9-20 get a little more interesting but seems a little dated. There are tips on how to make a leotard, stirrup pants and leg warmers. First copyright is from 1985 not its not improved much in the third edition. I would have enjoyed some better pictures too. If you have a decent manual this really isn't the book for you. For me it was too dated and too basic."
2,"Give it a try, even if you are a hard core LOTR fun","I read Hobbit and LOTR trilogy back in late 70's. The books were probably the equivalent of Harry Potter's to my kids today. So were the movies. While Harry Potter movie retraced the book faithfully, LOTR movie has to pack the vast LOTR universe into... well three installments of three hour movies, and the creators did a pretty good job with it. The movie brought the LOTR world to the real life just as I imagined it would be. While the movie omits certain stories and characters here and there, let's not be too picky about it. After all, a movie is a movie, and a book is a book. I am turning the pages of LOTR again after more than 20 years."
1,this movie sucks,it like this acting was nothing but a joke and the film was even the bad part of it i am telling u dont buy it or rent it i rent this movie i turn in off in 10mins of the movies the had a kool cover that only thing good about it
1,Travel Cart,The wheel fell off and the item did not work properly. I ended up leaving it in the airport in Atlanta.
2,Cheap and Good,My daughter and I must have small ear canals as we have trouble using earbuds. My daughter uses these with various techie gadgets and is very happy. The price was right. We were not expecting Bose.
1,LOL,"they should have put a a sticker on the box saying: "" may cause sleepness "" the mask looks like a michael myers mask rip-off! and the yellow slicker is like the black slicker from I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. and this movie is boring as hell! and they switch from this killer to another?! ROFL. this is lame! soooo lame!!"
2,muslim terrorist are taking over our US of A,"The muslims own our politicians, the ones they own are changing our laws in favor of the muslims, so the muslims can just move right in without firing a shot, our Justice Department is doing all of the dirty work for the muslims, the Oval Office is going right along with it."
1,This isn't Just a Sophomore Slump,"If you would like to read Ben Marcus before he got an agent, moved to New York, and strated worrying about being famous--as all the young Americans seem to worry about--read his first collection, The Age of Wire and String. There is none of the self-promotion you have in this novel. It's a startlinglybrave debut, that earlier book. This is one is just dredge."
2,Read the book and then watch this DVD,"I was too old for this war but have younger friends that served. They recommended the book to me. I found it an very moving detailed account of the type of thing that my friends told me about. I would recommend the book to anyone.Then I had the opportunity to see this DVD. While it was not completely true to the book, it is just as moving and more gut wrenching. My wife who does not like this type of movie was consumed and sickened by what happened to our soilders.The movie allows you get a very good idea of what the battle was like and allows you bring the horror of war move clearly into your heart. If you can read the book first."
2,See Spot Run,"After spending $40 at the auto store and marine store for products that failed, Spot-X did the job. This product worked great, but does require some elbow grease. Could not find this product anywhere retail, but had it three days from purchase, thru Amazon. Just amazed how well this product worked."
1,"Charger-OK, Batteries-NO","The charger seems to work well, but these batteries were a huge disappointment. I assumed that because these were recommended as the choice of professional photographers, they must be good. Wrong. They did not hold their charge well, especially in storage, and once drained, never recharged fully. I bought Duracell rechargeables and they are infinitely better. Buy those instead."
1,Amateur Night for Auditioning Terrorism Experts,"Neither author is versed in the subject of terrorism; they do not know the regions of the world they discuss nor do they have any international relations expertise. Their ""solutions"" include bureaucratic reshuffling, a hopeless enterprise (look at the Homeland Security mess!), and an ID card for everyone in the United States, hardly a solution for anything. This thing is high on drama and hubris, but there is no substantive contribution whatever."
2,"A very good bobby rydell collection,with 30 tracks.The sound could be better,as the songs are not off the original masters.","This is a nice album if you are just looking for the hits.For top notch sound,go with the cameo parkway edition of bobby rydell,its much better.I bought the marginal disc,because it had a couple of songs missing from the cameo release...The sound on this disc is compressed and dull sounding,and was not mastered off the original master tapes...A better choice is the cameo 25 song release...Thank you Stewart L."
2,The best!,This album always makes me feel good and that is really all I ask. This is my favorite album of all time.
1,Not like the real thing. Too flimsy.,"My four year old has a collection of these large Bruder toys. Bruder's DVD babbles on about how they are ""just like the real thing"" - but to be frank, given the premium price, they look the part but are made from the thin plastic that does not stand up to the rigors of outdoor play. I've given up on repairing them. Small items seem snap off with impunity and larger items just split (like the hopper beds on 2 dump trucks he has). Though my son's love for things Bruder continues - we are going to try and wean him off this brand and look for something more sturdier. As another reviewer mentioned - OK for indoors, but for sandbox and dirt pit areas, we suggest trying another brand."
1,Same old stuff for Jacky Chen,"For those who are facinated by Jacky Chen's incredable stunts, well, here is a rude awakening. He's been doing that for more than 20 years, and as a person growing up with Hong Kong Kong- Fu movies, I can attest that most of his moves, his stunts, even the facial expressions, the innocent looks from Rush Hour are deja-vus from his earlier Chinese movies. The only difference is that Jacky in the 90s is much older,, and he did all his stunts while he was still young"
2,Old time gospel blues...if there is such a thing!,"Mr. Kaiser has defined Christian blues. His gravelly voice and twangy guitar style set him apart. His music is blues, yet upbeat, and his lyrics inspirational and easy to listen to. It's just the blues guitar, with that loose string twangy sound, and a mean harmonica at times. Very folksy....reminds me gritty old time religion of Louisiana at times.Songs include: Great Change since I've Been Born, Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burnin, Shaky Ground, Nobody's Fault But Mine, Go Tell Pharoah, You Got to Move, In the Light of the Morning Star, Celestial Shore, Jesus is Comin Soon, God Don't Never Change, What You Did, I Belong to the Band, You Got to Die, Cornerstone, and We Shall see the King."
2,"Good, but not great","This halvah has quite a bitter aftertaste and not as many pistachios as I would expect. On the other hand, it is a great pick-me-up snack, and my husband enjoyed it with his breakfast."
2,Assorted bungees,"Good assorted package of bungees. Also, bought the Master lock steel bungees with carrier which is superior."
1,"True, but Sad Movie.","Sorry, but I did not like this movie. It was sad more than anything. I know Lefty was a killer and criminal, I could not help but feel sorry for him when he realized that his pal, ""Donnie"" was really an undercover officer. He had to play it off in front of his associates like it was nothing. The saddest part was when he realized that they were going to come get him, so he tells his wife to tell ""donnie"" that he liked working with him and doesn't regret it just in case he were to call. Then he goes into the next room to leave his watch, wallet, and some stuff behind for his wife before leaving their home because he could not tell her what was going down, and just had to face the inevitable. I know that he was a criminal, but it was still too sad to watch."
1,Cook makes his money selling books and seminars,"Cook's previous book, Wall Street Money Machine, was quiteinteresting. However, this new book, SMM is a shameless 260 pageadvertisement for his W.I.N network and all of his other tapes and seminars. That's the way he makes all of his money - by selling these books with all sorts of advertisements for his seminars, and including ""testimonials"" of totally inexperienced people who just got lucky on a trade. If you take out all of the advertisements, I'd rate this book a 7-8. His strategies can work, however one needs to do a lot of research before speculating on the market."
1,Not even well-meaning...,"Not everyone who is poor in America is so because of their own fault. This pointless work would have you believe that NO ONE who is poor in America is so because of their own fault Hello? HELLO?Big business, to look from the MOST cynical viewpoint, would love for everyone to be rich, just so they could buy more. I'd love to see Ken Lay sentenced to death, myself, but Enron is just an exception. Free market capitalism is the most efficient way to get the most people OUT of poverty...."
1,WAY overrated,"so this is 'atmospheric horror?' (excuse my pop reference.) first of all, the cover insults your intelligence. Lovecraft flatters Borges in the highest form, and his language is even worse than Poe's - awkward, verbose, ultimately annoying. the 'atmosphere' is arid, boring. writers (esp. horror and British) need to understand sometimes less is more: flowery & 'understatement' (for most Brits it's unnecessary adverbs and double negatives) only make you sound snobbish. (Lovecraft's pastiche aesthetic & snobbishness actually distract you from his racism.) his 'philosophies' are St. Olafian as well. I had to do a line of coke just to get through the first three pages. the real horror here is any possible amusement.so far I haven't found any horror writer in English worthy of mention. The early Ann Rice, William Blatty and Robert Aickman come close, though."
1,"Not accurate -- nor ""instant read""","Bought this and decided to test it before using it in an application where an accurate temperature reading was crucial. Although I own a fantastic instant thermometer (Thermapen) I wanted something I could clip onto a pot while cooking to measure temperature. I brought water to a full rolling boil and inserted the Taylor thermometer. Despite the words ""instant read"" on the package it took 25-30 seconds for the temp to climb to 180 degrees....water boils at 212 degrees. I put my Thermapen into the boiling water and within 4 seconds the temperature registered 212 degrees. I left the Taylor in the boiling water for 2 minutes and the temperature never rose above 185 degrees.Stay away from this item if you need accuracy or speed. If you want a slow inaccurate reading then this is the product for you."
2,"It is a classic epic, a complete story from beginning to end","Costner has created a real hero. As with many real life heroes, this one is created mostly by accident. The Postman begins as a humble traveling storyteller and ends up being the story. The common people are looking for someone (as we always are) to lead them out from the post war chaos. While the antagonist wants to impose a dictatorship on the people, the Postman becomes, by accident, their hope to restore the United States of America. In the end, it is the people who make the Postman a hero, and in that one critical moment, he answers the call. It is a truism that our heroes are usually not all the bad things they did but their glorious moment in the sun."
1,BEWARE WHEN BUYING THIS (EXCELLENT) non-FILM DVD!,"I assumed -- in retrospect, quite foolishly -- that I was purchasing the 1941 DVD film of ""The Sea Wolf,"" starring John Garfield and Edward G. Robinson. What a disappointment when I discovered this was a...BOOK!Five stars for quality of readability (assuming, of course, you actually enjoy reading a novel on a computer screen -- I do not!)...zero stars for Amazon for not having stated with absolute clarity that this product was a book -- NOT A FILM!And a dunce cap for me for having allowed wishful thinking to get the better of me by my failing to realize at once that there was no listing below the words ""Sea Wolf"" of the main character actors associated with the film (as is normally the case with DVDs).(A dispiriting sense of inertia prevents me from trudging two blocks to the post office to return this product.)"
1,two things I hate about OS X,"1. The difference between OS X and OS 9 is greater than anticipated. I've been using Macs since 1987 and was a bit flummoxed at first. There's some non user friendly stuff you have to deal with. It's not like going from OS 7 to OS 8 or OS 8 to OS 9, where anyone reasonably Mac savvy can get acclimated quickly. OS X is way different, too different, and different in annoying nonMac ways. Yeah, think different, thank you Steve Jobs.2. Font rendering. Jaguar has smoothed fonts THAT YOU CANNOT TURN OFF ABOVE 12 PT TYPE. It is absurd that the Mac, supposedly the computer for creative media artists yada yada does not give you the option to turn off font smoothing altogether. Anyone who loves to read clear sharp text will not like this."
1,Poor shaver,"I purchased this shaver 2 years ago and it's not very good. I don't have that much experience with electric shavers, but this one does not produce a close shave. It also leaves my skin red and irritated. The charging station itself doesn't really work either. I have to keep cleaning the connectors and jostling around the shave to get it to charge in the station."
2,Shocking,"I loved this book. It explores social interactions between young males, and the limits of the conscience. The ending was shocking... be prepared for an exciting story! (This is middle school reading)"
2,whats more entertaining than shooting fish in a barrel....,"destroying urk-hai as they run out at you from a million places!this game is great, the graphics are so smooth and the game play is amazing. Mixing scenes from the movie with video game cinamatics adds a more real effect.it has a very nice charecter system leveling up is a bit differant that other games, as well as the powerup purchasing.there are three charecters that you can play the adventure as and compare how you did with each. Legalos, Aragon / strider, and gimli! there all three soo cool.i dont want to go away and give anything away like how to defeat anything that up to you :Pill end with saying THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME.untill next time kill quickly !!--LoTr's fan"
2,Terrific book,This book extensively covered the complete field of computer-based crime. The author is well versed in computer systems and security. The CD provides a wide collection of tools and products. Recommended for beginner to advanced computer analysts and administrators.
2,This is another great book by the Author!,"I read World Stompers and also enjoyed that book. Eventhough this book does not have photo's(I'm a Photojournalist) it is a great piece of work. I would have listed a few more places than in the book, but still fantastic work.I have been to many of the places listed in this book and his description is 95% on track.Zentravel"
2,A Godsend for my dad,"I bought this phone for my dad because he has horrible hearing and has never been able to really talk much on the phone (the receiver gives his hearing aids terrible feedback). Additionally, most speakerphones mute the other party when one or the other is talking, so you really can't have a true interactive conversation like we are used to doing on the receiver. This speakerphone made it possible for my dad to talk to his friends and family that can't come to visit in person. I live 6 hours from him, and all we used to be able to do is email, but now we can enjoy conversations again. I can't say enough good things about this phone."
1,nothing new,"This book is just ANOTHER rehash of their first Carbohydrate book. They sure are milking this for all it's worth! Instead of offering something of substance with each subsequent book, they put all their effort into catchy new titles."
1,Awful,My child was so looking forward to making cotton candy with this machine. All I can say is that is smokes like crazy and makes what could best we described as a single lick of cotton candy. It's a complete waste of $$$.
2,Wow,"Remington Wet 2 Straight has done wonders with my hair. I have a naturally thick wavy hair that tends to frizz and usually no amount of ironing can keep it calm. This hair iron somehow manages to keep it straight all day long, it can be damp and muggy out and my hair still remains straight and no nonsense. The pessimist in me is still waiting for all my hair to fall out one day because the steaming effect on damp-to-wet hair tends to frighten me, but I've been using this for the past 3 months an no harm has come as of yet.Yes, it works on wet-out-of-the-shower hair. No, I wouldn't recommend it (mainly because with all the steam it's hard to avoid burning yourself). I recommend using this on damp hair, I usually let it air dry for about an hour or, if I can wait, I'll towel dry it and let it air for 10-15 minutes."
2,Beautiful,"In my opinion, Maria Callas simply cannot be compared to most other sopranos. Amazing collection here.."
1,"Can you say ""FRUSTRATING""???","Just took this one out of the box and even with a college education I can't figure out how to make it work!!! My 4 year old little boy clicks around aimlessly trying to make something work, to no avail! Unless I'm totally missing something, there are no real instructions as to what to do to get things going, there's only a big to-do about the art show and portfolio."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I am a bit surprised to read all of these damning reviews of Shawn Colvin's new album 'Whole New You'. In my opinion Shawn has tried new and different things with every album she's done. Whole New You only marks another change. Is an artist not allowed to change and evolve? Isn't that what art and creation is about? Whilst I don't think Whole New You is by any means a masterpiece, I do think it is a skilfully crafted collection of evocative and tuneful songs. A Matter Of Minutes is a superbly crafted and original work. And as far as getting away from her roots is concerned, I think Whole New You is perfectly in line with Shawn's other albums, however the production style has changed slightly to a slicker, more contemporary feel. The guitars are still in there. Do you people have ears? If you like well crafted, easy-going adult contemporary with a confessional twist, buy any Shawn Colvin album, including Whole New You."
1,Not a childrens' portrayal of the Christmas story ...,"Do not assume, just because Legos are involved, that this is a book to share with young children. The Holy Ghost is a frightening character, circumcision is accomplished with a knife the size of the infant Jesus, and the illustration of Herod's order to slaughter all male infants less than two years of age is complete with decapitated infants in the background! Both frightening and disappointing!"
1,Boring,I bought SHOUT first and then went and got this and boy was it a letdown. Very boring christian pop. Maybe 2 bright spots but this CD never finds it's way into my player as there is so much better christian music out there nowadays. If you are looking for 65 dba when they were in their techno/ dance vein pick up SHOUT or BUBBLE!!!
1,=sucks,I cant bleave this I got it for christmas and i thought it would be a little more fun the point is if you like games like zelda wrestlemania 2000 or even DK 64 this wouldent be for you but if you are some nerd who lives for chess then this is for you
2,Tons of Action in High Def,Surrogates [Blu-ray]Action and great graphics in hi def Blu-Ray. A great addition to your Blu-Ray DVD Collection !Fast and reliable delivery
2,would choose over zune dock/ihome any day,"Sure, the quality of sound isn't as good as that of a Zune Dock or an iHome, but it is about as good as a regular radio in your home or car is. For $10, this is well worth it, and I would choose this over an iHome/Zune dock any day!"
2,Very good text on International telecomm market,"I think anyone who is interested in learning how the international telecomm market works would find thisbook very valuable. This book helps to give the readera look behind the scene of the data and phone networkswe take for granted everyday, without a lot of technicaldetails."
1,My tracfone is better!,"I had this phone. I malfunctioned occasionally. I really wasn't impressed with tmobile coverage area:(. I got a tracfone(v60i motorola) And it has worked out much better. Tracfones promos like the referral- authorized person sends you a referral before you activate a new tracfone and you get 100 minutes at no charge! it rocks. I have way better coverage with my tracfone. I am now authorized to give referrals so if you need one, just send a request to sunnyryanj@yahoo, the v60i is cdma and if you like GSM phones tracfone also has those and they work on both cingular/att and tmobile so you get the best gsm coverage there is! and theres free roaming! Tracfone is better. mmhm..."
1,Easy Spanish Phrase Book,"This books is not very practical..It lacks every day phrases that are necessary in normal conversation,very limited in my opinion.."
2,Zella Mayzell Rockin',"I enjoyed the whole album, all the way through. They have great harmonies and the beats will stick with you all day. Can't wait to see these guys on the big stage, I have no doubt their going to keep on rockin'."
2,It is what it is,"Ordered the movies and they are exactly as expected. Besides adding a personal thought about the movies, i'm not really sure what else to say. Nice packaging?"
1,Novelization is the wrong medium for this story,"I'm not going to waste time talking about plot, character development, story, writing, etc. with this book because, frankly, I would actually have to invent some sense of these things on behalf of this book in order to discuss them at all. This collection of pages would have been better suited as a screenplay for a direct-to-TV SciFi channel cheese festival film. This book is borderline absurd."
2,Not Sure,I am not sure right now how well this product works. I shook the granules around the house and I saw Mickey twice. I also have a Rat Zapper which I know its avoiding because it saw what happened to its buddy. My three year old left a piece of bacon on the floor and it was there for three days without me knowing. There were no signs of mickey nibbling on it so I guess it works.
2,I got cash $$$$$$$$,"Another album that I purchased because of a song that I heard on tv. I GOT CASH!!!! Everyone who considers themselves real, should listen to this song. I call it the ultimate kiss off to yuppies who think they are better than everyone else."
2,Love it!,I am using the DVD in a classroom for preschool students with disabilities and they love it! One has already started using the potty after watching the DVD for 3 weeks. She sings the songs when she goes to the bathroom!
1,Bad product,This product does not work at all. I will never buy it again. I purchased this product because Dr Oz said it would work but I guess he can be wrong to.
2,Bleeding of the Stone,"Set in southwestern Libya near Ghat, ""The Bleeding of the Stone"" is the life story of an isolated Bedouin herdsman. Faced with the absurdities of modern life, herdsman Asouf is forced to examine every aspect of his life and beliefs in deciding how to respond. Testimony to a lifestye rapidly disappearing in Libya and elsewhere in North Africa and the Middle East, the protagonist prizes the purity and simplicy of bedouin life and identifies closely with the creatures found in the desert. The first of Ibrahim al-Koni's novels to be translated into English, it is hoped this novel will be followed by many more."
2,The Plant Light,I am very pleased with this product. I am using it to grow a baby African Violet and it is doing quite well. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have enough light but loves to grow these and other beauties!
1,This one is buggy,"I bought two of these. The first one overheated and failed within two months. Seagate replaced it with the 400 GB model that has been working fine. It looks like the second one is now running hot and doomed to fail, the only good thing is that it is under the year warranty.If you do buy these, then remember to DVD backup, else when the drive overheats, nothing will get your data back.----Addendum. Well, I've had two of these for two years now, and no additional failures. I leave them on all day long, and the read-write is fast and works with my computer.I use one for photo/video backups and the other as a straight backup.So far, these have been the best performers of all the external HD's I have purchased."
2,Intense Emotional and Sensual Suspenseful,Marly's Choice is a the first book in one of the most emotional and erotic series of books I have ever read. It features the August Brothers who suffered abhorant abuse as young men and how this effects the brothers and the bond between the woman they love will have to be special - this first books is a fabulous start and a must for those that love a book that will grab you and keep you within its craps from page to page - This is a keeperand from the one of the most talented authors I have ever had the honor to readThis book is a Keeper
2,"The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition is a valuable resource for the business writer","In this modern age of e-mail, the written word has risen to become, in many cases, the most vital ""image product"" provided by a company. In many instances, customers determine whom their suppliers will be solely based on written communication. Ambiguity and errors found in written documents convey an unprofessional image.The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition will help guide your decisions when you are faced with questions related to diction, writing style, and punctuation. In short, this book will help you become a better business writer and project a more professional image."
2,Vital car safety equipment,"As seen tested on Mythbusters! This compact, inexpensive tool can save lives by helping you escape a car during a wreck if you can't release the seat belt latch or get the window down. It has a safety blade (cutting edge only on the inside of a hook)to cut seat belt webbing and a pointed hammerhead that will easily shatter a car window even when you can't break it without a tool. It's day-glow orange for easy visibility, is compact enough to fit in a glovebox or dash console and comes with a mounting bracket in case you want to put it somewhere else in your vehicle for easy access. I bought one for each of our vehicles."
1,Good product bad battery.,"I had no problem with the seller, the product came in good condition without any visable defects.The problem is that the battery didn't work upon arrival, after I replaced the battery (it is not one intended for replacement and I tinker in electronics a bit), The headset work as intended.Because of the nature of the headset the battery is very hard to replace and not intended to be replaced by the average user. So while the product worked as intended after a battery replacement, many customers may get a headset that dosen't work because of this problem."
1,The Author Is Now Serving Life In Prison - All Lies,"Do a quick Google search on the author and ""Barry Gibbs"", the innocent man he framed for the murder of a prostitute in 1986, and who served almost 19 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit.May Louis Eppolito live a long life. Behind bars.Don't waste your money."
2,Excellent book that inspires you to live more creatively!,"A book written by someone who has been reading his whole life. As Zeldin gives the history of the different traits of humans, you question your own traits and it encourages you to think with more awareness of how you live. Moreover, Zeldin refreshingly avoids being too Anglo-centric, and gives sufficient space to the history of humanity in East Asia or the Middle East. Also incredible is the bibliography at the end of every chapter, very broad... Only thing that seemed oddly missing is the history of humour, though as it is, the book is long enough. All in all a great, refreshing and though-provoking book."
2,My kid loves this book!,"Great book that my 2-year-old and I get a big kick out of! Not your average book - a little ""off-beat"" and unique which is why we like it! No miracles yet in the potty training area...."
2,Nothing further is needed,"I would recommend this set for any discriminating Jimmie Rodgers enthusiast. Some of the alternate takes alone make this more worthwhile than a less comprehensive set, especially the February 5, 1932, take of ""Mississippi Moon."" Also, the fidelity of the August 1932 and May 1933 records is fully captured, and reveals a different timbre to Rodgers' voice. My only slight complaint would be that the same source material from the Rounder set was used here, especially disappointing on ""Home Call"" (February 1932); ""No Hard Times"" (August 1932); and ""The One Rose"" (July 1930). I fully realize that these discs are hard to find, but surely such a project could command optimal discs, as it does for most of the set.If you want to move on up from your Rounder set, or if you simply wish to have it all--buy this by all means."
2,Good dog,"I recently purchased the iRobot Dirt Dog. I had a regular iRobot for years but the dog and cat fur finally killed it. I hoped that this one would work better and last longer. Because it is new, I can't say how long it will last, but it does clean better than my first iRobot. I have two cats and two dogs with lots of shed fur. I run the Dirt Dog every other day and my floor gets clean without having to pull out the big vacuum. I start the Dirt Dog when I get home from work. While I'm cooking dinner, the floor gets clean. With so much going on in our lives, it's good to so easily multi-task.I would recommend the Dirt Dog to anyone with pets.I gave it four stars instead of five because Dirt Dog doesn't pick up very light weight items, like small pieces of chocolate kiss wrappers."
1,Can we give zero stars?,"This is one of the worst toys my son has ever gotten. It took two adults about 30 minutes to put it together. The charger for the car is, unbelievably, powered by batteries. Why Mattel didn't make it AC powered is beyond me. This simply reinforces my belief that the toys companies and the battery manufacturers are in cahoots.Once you get the car charged, it will get through the chamber at most twice, assuming the planets align, before it gives out and is unable to climb the sides any more. Then you have to charge it all over again.Do NOT buy this product. Mattel should be ashamed."
1,Slot Game,this game is nothing like what i thought it would be.it is really not very realilistic.i don't like it and don't play it.[...]i would NOT recomment it to anyone.
1,Impressively Awful.,"This lame brained usher wanna be debut is just as awful as it is, lame songs, idiotic lyrics and other terrible stuffChris brown tries to be the 2000's version of usher, but he fails.Usher in the 90's had style, charm and heart and this one doesn't."
1,Disappointing,"Keegan tackles a difficult subject, but comes up with little. He seems intend on having a Clausewitzian encounter with the premises of Clausewitz. He tries so hard to prove that Clausewitz was wrong, and it gets tiring. Keegan is also not afraid to make the facts stand on their heads - like his description of site 117. He really wants us to believe that the Greeks invented ""total war"", but neglects other cultures like the Hawaiian that do not fit in with his views. Overall this book was a great disappointment."
1,Instant Immersion Mandarin Chinese Review,"I find the format difficult to follow unless you know the lanuage. It is not good for a beginner, but someone who is more advance in the lanuage, say someone that had already studied it for a year."
1,Hard to believe this is a Demy movie: BAD,"If you are a Demy fan like me, who loved Cherbourg and Demoiselles, do not spend money to see this awful, sordid little movie. It's not a musical, it's not a romance, just a boring tale of ships passing in the night. Amazon's welcome to my $15, but I sure wish I could have my 90 minutes back."
2,Maddeningly incomplete,"I agree with all the other reviewers who are frustrated at what got left off. Every time I put on disc number 4 and fail to find ""She's My Best Friend"" from the 'VU' album on there I'm reminded of this. I'm always left with the distinct impression that these record companies should let the fans compile the box sets.The band is great, of course. A legend. Original, timeless music and words. That's why I've given 4 stars. Having said that, the first disc of demos is for completists only. You'll probably not play it all the way through even once.Like others, I'd recommend not starting here. Buy the remastered albums (the 'banana LP' and 'Loaded' now come in deluxe double CD versions), especially the more polished mix of the 3rd untitled album. Then maybe buy this last.Oh, and get yourself the 'VU' collections. So you can hear ""She's My Best Friend""."
1,Shameful and pathetic...,It's shameful and pathetic that any publisher would presume to censor Mark Twain by sanitizing Huckleberry Finn as Barron's has done. I urge anyone who loves literature to boycott this travesty of an edition.
2,Fabulous recording!,"My wife and I listened to this CD several times and enjoyed it thoroughly. The arrangements are gorgeous, well-recorded and set the perfect tone for a serene non-commercial holiday. Some material was familiar, some not, and the acoustic instruments and voices do justice to the medieval material while freshening it with a few modern twists.Highly recommended!"
2,Excellent Resource,This book is an excellent resource for therapists who wants to know more about psychotropics or for beginning prescribers. I am a final year nurse practitioner student and I find this book a wonderful book to have for review and reference.
2,"""Confederates in the Attic""","An excellent book, clearly explaining what the South is and how it got that way. Absolutley impartial to either side of a very partial topic, Tony Horowitz has managed a balanced, honest look at the modern South. A book that is at once a history text, a sociological treatise and a comedy of errors. Anyone interested in the Civil War, civil rights and modern racism should read this book."
2,"great price, free shipping","perhaps not the greatest safe ever built, but i feel it's adequate and feel quite secure using it. price was right, shipping free. researched, couldn't do better. thanks amazon."
2,Great Lavalier Mic,"I use this mic with a wireless system and it has very good clarity and is very hot, it will pick up loud noises from a distance of about 40 ft., so I turn down my mic recording level to eliminate that problem. My only complaint is the mic clip that came with the unit will not hold the mic, it pops out of the clip without fail. I would think Sony would send a mic clip with the product that is engineered to work with the product it is packaged with. That is the reason for a four star rating. As far as quality goes it is a five star product. I use a wire adjustable clip and it works just fine."
1,Pato,"I've bought the cable for using it with my notebook (SPDIF out) and my home Theater Receiver YAMAHA. It doesn't fit my receiver optical input, actually is completly different from all others optical cables I have."
2,great pots and pans,"These stainless steel pots and pans are great! It is good value for the money. I bought these for my college going son. I did not want to spend as much as Alclad, but still wanted something that would last a while. He loves them. One thing he did mention is that the pot he uses for pasta got rainbow colored spots. I think that perhaps he used very high heat setting. I think that medium heat is all you need to use with this set. Overall, for look, price and performance, I would highly recommend this set."
1,lasted less than a year,"I did my homework and bought this blender based on consumer reviews from Amazon. It lasted for for about a year....light usage, average once per week. The plastic teeth broke on the bottom of the glass jug (everyones complaint now). But the real disappointment??? I contacted Braun via e-mail to see if they could send me a replacement part (which I was willing to buy, but have since seen that they will send them for free), and they didn't even have to courtesy to respond. No customer service? Forget them."
1,Stay away....it will not last even 1 year....,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. It has no UV protection whatsoever. It started to deteriorate in less than 7 months. You would expect a product to last several years. I hope Char-Griller product folks would read these reviews and pull the cover products off the market....or make products that last much longer.
2,Mokkie's Review,"I ordered the Presto Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker, I have nothing bad to say about the product or about Amazon. I got my order pretty much on time...1 day late with free shipping. I've ordered from Presto before with no complaints or with Amazon at this time.Mookie in Chicago"
2,A next book in a series.,"Many would say that Robert Jordan isn't capturing his original writting, as in his first 3 books in this series. I think this is false. It is false because many people fail to see that it isn't his writing that has gotten worse, it is the plot that has gotten smaller in the books. This isn't bad because it alows him to fill in detail he wouldn't be able to fill if there was action and adventure all through the book. This book certainly has more action that the previous 3, but it still fills the void of detail some people want more of."
1,Recording quality ok.. but no 640x480 preview!!!,"Nice compact box, and recording quality better than I expected.One major flaw though, no preview when recording 640x480 resolution, just a black screen with 'REC' in the top corner.Dropping back to 320x240 resolution doesn't help, this just displays the video preview in a tiny letter-box in the center of the display.A real shame, I love the concept, but the lack of preview is a real problem.Technical support claims that a future firmware upgrade will fix it, I'll keep my fingers crossed, but don't have high expectations."
2,Funny stuff,"Having seen the movie of the same name, I checked out the book. It's a funny account of Barris's life. I don't believe the CIA stuff for a minute, but it's fun to to see someone sort of create a new life story for themself because they weren't happy with the truth.Note to parents: there is a fair amount of sexual content in this book (I would've preferred more Gong Show anecdotes!) and a TON of foul language. Depending on their age, I would keep this book away from children, or at least read it first before letting them."
2,Just what I was looking for,"Here in Las Vegas, its either HOT or COLD. I hate trying to hold a hot or cold steering wheel, and I stink at keeping driving gloves around. I wanted a steering wheel cover that wasn't vinyl, and this is just what I was looking for. It was easy to get on, it doesn't slide around, its easy to take off to wash, and it matches the interior of the car. Very, very happy with this product."
1,OK,It was ok. The belly book was much better and I have never used this I went threw it and was disappointed
2,Very Thorough Learning Resource,"This is a solid reference work for professionals in the learning and development space. It covers not only the theory and design, but also gives practical applications that are useful in the professional world.I use this as a resource for creating online training courses, where most of these principles still apply.It's a huge book (over 600 pages), so it's not exactly a weekend read, but very useful for learning professionals or those who are interested in human resources. I recommend a copy for your reference library."
2,One of the best books I have ever read.,This ranks right up there with The Hobbit. In fact it is the only book I can honestly say I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed the Hobbit. Joan Wolf captures the spirit of Authur completely with this book.
2,I Love This Movie!,"It's very morbid but this case fascinates me. I know it IS a true story. I remember seeing this movie when I was 12 for the first time, yes I said 12. Since then I've seen it at least 15 times and now I own it. I've also read the book about the case, Evidence of Love, and I own that also. The book is very close to the movie itself, surprisingly. At the time I first saw it, I wasn't able to look it up on the internet, but since then I've researched it and that is how I came across the book. If anyone wants to see the real people and the real ""victim"", you can go to the crime library online and just type in Betty Gore or just search her name and it will come up. There was also a Murder by the Book special recently on court, oops, I mean trutv. I would like to see more about this case and would very much like to know where the people are today! I can't believe there isn't more on this case."
2,Excellent Product,"To me this is the best product for straightening my long thick wavy hair, I have tried many others with poor results. It gets much hotter than the other flat irons I have tried, there are ten intervals of heat and 10 is super hot, so people with thinner hair might not want to turn the heat on full blast. It makes my hair SUPER straight and smooth, and it is super durable, because I have taken this on so many trips and dropped it about 1000 times and it's still working as well as the day I got it. Highly recommended!!"
1,Pop-up Play Barn,Gave this to my 4-year-old niece for Christmas and she played with it for a while then moved on. It's small; really just big enough for her and a few toys. Easy pop-up and break down; great for small places and small people.
1,Didn't work for me,I bought this pump because of all the great reviews but I had nothing but frustration with this pump. I would pump for up to 20 minutes sometimes & only get 1 ounce if that. My milk would not let down with this pump at all. I ended up get a cheaper electric pump & had much better luck.
2,USA-IRELAND COUNTRY A WINNER,"As I expected, this was like all Daniel O'Donnell's DVDs, ""GREAT"". I really wish the whole show could have been on one DVD."
1,"Where is ""Bring on the Men""?","The two best songs in Jekyll & Hyde were ""Bring on the Men"" and ""Letting Go"". Why are they missing from this disk?"
1,broke in two months,"I bought the 16 inch Scotts and used it for two months. It cut great up until two months. It started skipping and just rolled without engagement with the blades. I have a small yard with hills so I try to push hard. Now get this, I returned it thinking it was just a lemon and got a new one. Guess what? Same result broke down in two months. Now I wish I had the own ones. Seems like inside the wheel is just cheap plastic parts. Problem is that I don't have much choice here on Maui, Hawaii."
1,Kludgy Software. Poor Tech support,"My experience was similar to that of topher666. On a brand new laptop, on which the OEM DVD player ran fine, this software ran extremely slowly with no sound. Tech support was of no help. After filling out a long form on the gocyberlink website, they do not even respond directly to you. You have to login into your account to check if a response has been posted. This is anyway just a form response, to reinstall the program after first editing your registry (something most people are rightfully reluctant to do) to complete the uninstall. The form has to be filled out all over again for each follow-up. I gave up after three weeks of fruitless exchanges, after having sent at their request several diagnostic files, with not a single constructive suggestion."
2,Killas Unite,This is the ATOM BOMB. Halfbreed is formerly House of Krazees. Mad Insanity is to kids that talk about hating women and coat hanger abortions. Jaymo of Krazy Klan is now Anybody Killa who raps with Blaze Ya Dead Homie. It's music like this that stops me from slitting my wrists.
2,well done,"This book has an amazing prose style and a fast-paced clip which moves the plot along briskly. It is entertaining and the characters are (at least to a prep-school graduate) easily recognizable, which lends them more depth than they are actually given. The characters are less stereotype and more caricature and work well within the novel. The ending is what kept this book from a 5-star rating. It leaves many things unexplained and gives some things too much explanation. Otherwise, it is brilliantly done and well worth the read."
2,OEM HP 21 Black inkjet cartridges,Original OEM Product delivered as advertised. Shipping was very fast. I will buy from this seller again.
2,Exactly what I was looking for!,The enclosure was exactly what I was searching for. I needed a discrete place to place my garbage cans outside. It was a little shorter that I had imagined but perfect for the job.
2,The Best One Yet,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5) is quite possibly the best installment in this series yet. Rowling had more time to write this one, and it certainly shows. That's saying something, given how excellent the previous book was. What I really liked best about the 5th book is its dealings with the Magic World's government and how the government is not always as reliable as it may seem. Lots of characters and things from previous books that seemed so reliable are suddenly unreliable in this book. Plus, Harry, Ron, Hermione and their friends are all finally looking forward to their futures--a true sign of their growing up.Filled with surprises (some good, some painful), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a wonderful read. I'm already waiting for the next installment!"
2,america live,"I saw them live a year ago, fantastic live, the dvd was ok, not one of there best. I'm sure there is better out there."
2,"Good, but a little over my head","It was very difficult for me to put this book down! While I am only 16 (15 at the time I read it), I enjoyed it quite a bit. The plot is good, and so are the sub-plots (there is even a bit of romance!). However, some of it I skipped over because it goes very deep into theological things, which made some parts a bit dry. Even so, I recommend this book."
2,Size doesn't matter,"This disk is delightful. In short packages (about 25 minutes each) one gets four masses by JS Bach that have many of the features we look forward to in his much larger works. The playing and singing are mellifluous and exuberant, and given the fact that you get 2 discs, it's a real bargain. Don't hesitate if you're interested!"
2,A true must for blues lovers,"This cd is a must for anyone that truely loves the blues. Chris is able to carry you off not only with the sounds of his guitar wrapping around you but also with his voice as he releases each word. My favorite song on this cd is ""One Step Ahead Of The Blues"",I as many others ,I'm sure, can relate to it. Ever since this one came out I have been patiently waiting for the next one. Pleeeeease we need another one Chris."
2,Airplane Fun,This is a good toy for either a boy or a girl. It's rather cute too. Well made and good for parents to use with even younger babies.
2,Great product!,I really love the scent of this soap along with the texture. It leaves hands feeling smooth. I've actually received compliments from people who have asked me what perfume I was wearing when I was wearing none - stating that it has a very clean smelling fragrance.
1,Pleased...then not so much,"Bought this humidifier to keep the bedroom comfortable during the winter months. It has a lot of great features, like the warm mist and dual-facing outflow nozzles so you can get more coverage.After reading the instructions (some humidifiers are touchy), I placed it on a flat, non-absorbant surface as recommended. This product worked GREAT the first time I used it.The next day, I filled it up the next day and left for work, hoping to return to a much less dry home when I got back. What I returned to was water all over the bedroom floor, because the humidifer had decided to dump it's contents right out of the bottom.I buy from Amazon religiously, and rarely have a problem with any of their items, but I can say for certain - between mine and others' negative experiences with this product, they should stop carrying it until some serious quality control issues are fixed.Returned for refund."
1,lab manual for millers env science,it is very good but it has many labs that have more lab materials than I have at my disposal. i wish there were more virtual labs or ones with less equipment
2,Very nice design,"Turns out that the body is made of glass and except for the metal frame, everything else is plastic. It says so on the box. Also, it says it makes 32 ounces, but I was only able to pour in about 25 ounces of water. The design is very attractive and practical. The main reason I bought this was because cleaning is very easy. The infuser is basically a strainer that fits nicely into the body. This way it's works like brewing a cup of tea by just tossing the leaves into the water. The only downside to this design is that you can't leave in the infuser basket/strainer and pour the tea without some leaves falling into the cup, though they don't recommend doing it this way anyway. Also, many people prefer to remove the basket so their tea won't get too strong when you reach the end so it's a moot point. I'm happy with my purchase."
1,A chink in the armor!,"I received this case today and was looking forward to taking the worry out of dropping my HTC Titan. Everything looked good and fitted well. Then, while lovingly palming phone, I found that the ""Secure side closure design"" (so described) was anything but secure. It simply takes turning the phone over in your hand to disengage the latch. Very irritating!BoxWave HTC Titan Armor Case - The Metal Case, Heavy Duty Protective Case (Jet Black)"
1,Mold in the lid...Uh Yuck!,I bought this mug a few months ago and thought it was great! Then a few days ago I noticed these black chunks of mold coming out of the lid while washing it..At first I though there was just something in the sink..I kept on washing it and pressing the open/close tab even used a brush that came with my daughters bottles..Still the black chunks kept coming out..So gross! I don't even want to think about all the mold chunks that I drank with my tea..The mug itself is great..If they could only fix the lid..
1,Disappointed fan,"I was SO looking forward to Annie's new CD but I was incredibly disappointed with Bare. Musically, it sounds very much like all of her other solo work. Lyrically, it's pain and angst all the way. After a couple of songs I wanted to say ""get over it Annie, spare us the details, we've all been there"". Overall it's just a boring CD. As another reviewer said ""bring back the Eurythmics"" or at least get a different producer, get a renewed outlook on life, try writing in a different style. Or just put your incredibly beautiful voice to work on some great covers...how about some great old standards or jazz. Please, Annie, something different next time."
2,One of my favorite books ever!!!,"Several books have influenced my way of thinking on a day to day basis. Reading this book (in hardcover) has influenced me into animal activism. I cried at the injustices brought out in this book, and realized my inactivity was a stamp of approval for the irresponsible and inhumane treatment of animals that Dr. Fouts has pointed out. I have fortunately never witnessed these horrible abuses first-hand like he has. (If I had, would I be able to sleep?)He does a beautiful job of creating our connection with chimps and other creatures, and I thank him for that.HEY EDUCATORS....CONSIDER MAKING THIS REQUIRED READING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Rap/Hip Hop's future!,"This is is the first time I heard Fabolous! I just bought the CD so I can try new rappers and i was really impressed by his work! Now i m thinking of buying Ghetto Faboulous and More Street Dreams!Now about the Album:It opens with a brief intro with fabolous talking about the album! Then it goes to Not Give A F**k! After listening to the track I was surprised! I only asked one question to myself: ""How come this song is not a single?"" But then after almost every song I asked the same question!! This album is filled with great songs!After the other great rappers (Who r either retired or dead for ex. Tupac, Buggie, DMX and Jay Z etc...) This rapper Fabolous is the future!!!!"
1,Inventing Being,"I am not a poetry lover and this book did nothing to convince me otherwise. For 200 pages (100 actually- half the book is the original poems in Hungarian, the other half translated to English) the poet rambles on and on about his search (and struggle) for love through muddled images of flowers and starry nights. I think the poet's goal behind this descriptive style is to pull the readers into a dream like world to better illustrate his confusion, but instead it just becomes annoying. I couldn't even finish it."
1,Didn't work for me...,"Not much else to report. Took it as directed, couldn't tell any difference - none."
2,Another good one,"A page turner, granted it's nothing really new if you read Marcinko, McNabb, Weisman... But you get what you came for. The shopping list gets a little tiring though, brand name dropping at every chance."
1,Didn't work-twice,My son got this for his birthday and it didn't work. It was like the batteries kept dying even though we put new ones in. It wouldn't read the stories and would just fade away. We ended up tossing it because we already threw out the box so were unable to return it. He happened to get another one for Christmas which doesn't work either. This time it doesn't recognize the books when they are put in and skips because it will recognize it one minute and then say to insert a book the next. We won't be trying a third time.
1,Battery was in bad condition from Amazon,"I have a Back-UPS 1000VA. I use it overseas in South Asia where there are frequent power outages. Batteries usually last about a year or two.I bought one of these on one of my last trips to the States. On the second day of use, I noticed that the battery didn't hold charge properly. It drops from 100% charge to 60% charge in a matter of seconds, then discharges at a normal rate. This should never occur with a new battery. Unfortunately, I don't think Amazon takes returns on batteries, nor is that an option for me from my current location overseas.So just a general FYI and heads up. Buyer beware, there's a chance you could get a faulty battery from Amazon which doesn't hold its charge properly.I have previously purchased my batteries new from Ebay and have never had a problem with any of them."
1,Interpol Already?,"Isn't it premature for Interpol-influenced bands? I'm certain they'd hate the comparison, but Stellastarr* draw from the same pool of influences. Yet where Paul Banks' affect-less vocal style adds tension to Interpol's gothic reminiscences, Shawn Christensen's preening vocals come across as three types of pompous. Amanda Tannen's wispy sweet background vocals add color to the drab surroundings, particularly on the nearly bearable ""Somewhere Across Forever"". After that, it's hiccupping sub-par David Byrne strangulations and dreadful lyrics (my favorite is when Christensen says he wants to blame his bad breakup ""on the artist in me"" - yeah right!). And what's with that damn asterisk in the band name? Was a perky little heart trademarked?"
2,Typical Segal but still enjoyable,"The video on this Blu-ray version is sharp and clear and the sound is crisp without any distortions.It's typical Steven Segal vs the bad guys so, yeah, you already know who's gonna win, and ya' know there's gonna be alot of gun fire, knife action, martial arts and explosions. But what the heck, it's a Steven Segal movie and these are to be expected so have a pizza delivered, sit back, turn up the sound on your home theater and just enjoy it."
1,Printer does not power off.,"I have had this printer for a couple of weeks now. The prints are of great quality, but the blasted thing does not power off (unless of course you unplug it). Kodak support is giving me the runaround, as one support person states that it is a defect and another states that it is a ""feature"" to remain on and that a power switch was not included in order to save on cost. They have also indicated that there will be no firmware update to resolve the issue. The camera dock that shipped with my camera does not have this problem. Has anyone else encountered this ""feature""? Poor design and customer support!"
2,Stone Alone,"I've read several books about the Rolling Stones and also many other rock bios and to date this one is the best. B Wyman is thorough and meticuluous, at times almost to a fault, but if one really wants to learn about those early days of these five guys and the others around them and what it was really like this is the book to read. Bill was there on the inside yet in many ways also on the outside. He was able to remove himself and look within. Unlike many similar books about The Rolling Stones it is unbias and does not have an agenda. There is very little glitter and self adoration and he has nothing to prove. This book is an honest read and a great read."
2,Good instrument,This has many available choices for watch backs. The watch back must have slots. It is very easy to adjust and removes the back without any problems. In time the cost of this item will save money in taking your watch to a jeweler to have the battery replaced.
1,Really bad :(,That a bad star for clay aiken this c-d is really borring and all the songs sound the same. One listen of this album is enought to say don't waste your money into this c-d. Really peace of nothing.
2,A Fabulous Unsung Diamond,"genius.period.why didn't Aorta catch fire commercially?absolutely baffling.it makes me ponder how many undiscovered musical orchids in the wilderness there might be...?i am so pleased to have found this cluster of reviews, and particulary pleased to see the post by Dan Hoagland, and mention of James Vincent's website. It helps fill in for me what had been for so long a void of information about Aorta.Is the second Aorta album for sale anywhere?I remember in 1974 driving by the Sprinkle Road to Cork Street exit when driving to Chicago from Michigan. It was weird to realize the name of one of Aorta's compositions was taken from a highway I often traveled on."
2,"No sophomore slump, but there's room for improvement","This album gets off to an AMAZING start, but, unfortounantley, this is not sustained throughout the entire album. ""Wake Up"" is dreadful, and the last three songs ""Slow Down"", ""Samsonite Man"", and ""Nobody Not Really"" are average. But the rest is enough to save it from the sophomore slump."
2,Sense and Sensibility,I'm a Jane Austen fan so this was a nice read and interesting as the characters ring true.
2,great product...right lenght for two bikes,"great product...long enough to attach two bikes-wheels-seats. Simple to use. works for my intended use & wouldstop a grab-and-run situation, but probably would not stop someone with a rugged/big cable cutter."
2,Decent Brush,"I got this to replace my horse hair brush. Atleast I think it was horse hair. Definitely not badger hair. The Tweezerman brush only cost me $13 so I thought it would be a good place to start with the badger hair brushes which can get quite expensive.The first couple of times of use it lost some hairs but not alot and that seemed to cease. The horse hair brush I had was much softer but didn't make a lather with the soap like this one does. This brush creates a nice thick lather with shaving soap, seems fairly well made and dosen't look too cheap so if you're just getting into using a brush and soap for shaving the Tweezerman badger hair brush isn't a bad place to start."
1,Underwhelming,Wow - not impressed at all. I guess you truly get what you pay for. These produce a really shallow sound that's either tingy or over-bassed (depending on your bass volume setting). After 15 min. trying the bass volume at different settings I just couldn't find one that was acceptable. Something about the sound of these speakers irritates the crap out of me! I'll probably return them and upgrade. If you're going to use them a lot for music and movies - i highly recommend throwing down some extra bucks - I'm returning these!FYI: the ipod holder?? are you kidding me logitech? that is the cheesiest gimmick i've seen - can't believe you even wasted your time producing that flimsy POS.
2,Footnotes!,"What you'll like about this edition is the explanatory footnotes on the bottom of the page--so you don't have to flip back and forth to consult brief notes that do help give hints and context for many of Cervantes' references. Like Dante, Cervantes made lots of these references (usually ironic or satiric)--to authors, works, customs, and so forth--and while you can enjoy the book without knowing precisely what they mean, it's a lot more enjoyable to have them. Grossman's translation is certainly a competent one--but the fact is that no one has been totally successful in translation Cervantes into modern English idiom; his 16th century prose is very ornate, with odd positioning of subject, verb, and object, and tends to be slow going for modern readers."
1,A One-sided Report,"To quote the late sacred elder of Western research and writing, C. Leland Sonnichsen, ""I don't see why this book had to be written!"" The reason is that the writer had pre-selected his conclusion and considered only information that tended to prove his prejudice. This is so obvious as to turn off an unbiased reader.Save your money. This book is unsliced baloney."
1,not it,"I have tried EVERY hair product that has to do with anti-frizz. This oleo relax elixir was $43.00 and performed like a $3.00 generic rip off. I have been a long faithful of Farouk Biosilk Silk therapy, which is less then half the price and way better. Always looking for something better, I just tried a product called Smooth N Shine Strait Out. This cost $5.99 and blows all the products I have used til now, completely away. I guess when you see price you think more expensive must be better, but not true. This product is NOT IT!"
2,An absolute Must Read!!,I missed the last George Clooney episode of ER reading this book and it was totally worth it. Couldn't put it down. Now I have a new author to keep an eye on.
2,Most Used Knife in My Kitchen,"I currently have four Shun knives, all frequently used in my kitchen. This knife, however, is used multiple times each day. I find that the size and weight are perfect for almost everything. It makes slicing large onions, delicate herbs, and sticky cheeses a breeze. While I do go with smaller paring knives for a few tasks (peeling, garlic, and coring primarily), and my larger heavy duty chef's knife for larger tasks (gourds and squash, quickly getting through large bunches of greens, etc), I've found that this knife is really the right size for everything else. I have small hands, and find that the angled construction makes knife tasks a lot easier and more comfortable for me.I would recommend this knife for anyone thinking of venturing into Shun knives. You will be amazed with the smooth cutting ability, and the fact that this is such a versatile knife will allow you to justify the initial cost. Well worth it."
2,America : A Patriotic Primer,The Book is great & the Kids love it. They also can learn a lot from this Book. It is number 1-A perfect for Kids.
2,Fun top but didn't last long.,I bought this top for my 4yr. old for Christmas last year. He liked the colors of it and the colors when it was spinning were hypnotizing but after a few months the handle stripped and bent.
2,I Want to Trust the Author,"The book is easy to read but because of the approach to ""reversing"" diabetes I am still seeking answers. I have begun a slow carb regiment and have lost a few pounds but my blood sugar is still spiking. Time will tell.."
1,dyson spelled g-a-r-b-a-g-e,"biggest pile ive ever bought, with nonexistent customer service they should go out of business. bad service with a bad product = dont buy"
1,Nice looking but didn't work or last well,Great looking and seemed to be of high quality but out of the box there were problems that got worse over time: kettle leaked when the water boiled; it didn't whistle all of the time; due to the spherical design there is not a lot of flat surface for the bottom and on our gas stove it was often unstable until you adjusted it to sit 'just so'; the stainless stained and we could not get the stains out of the brushed surface; then lid started to fall apart after some time. In the end we asked to return it. I gave it two stars since the cost to quality/endurance ratio just was not very good in my opinion.
1,Boring.,"I wonder if Pullman actually knew what he was getting into when he started this fantasy trilogy. This book goes absolutely nowhere, and it was difficult to finish. I couldn't care less for any of the characters, and I really hope they don't make a movie out of it."
1,"A very, very bad movie",I recently witnessed this car crash of a movie. I usually like parodys but this movie was boring and unfunny.
2,SERMONS BY TAYLOR,Great collection of sermons by an unusually gifted writer. Liked it so well trhat I have purchased from Amazon six additional copies for gifts.
1,Alfred Hitchcock Ending,"While I have enjoyed many Stephen King books and movies over the years I could not get interested in The Mist. I kept reading - it is, after all, short, so it didn't take much time. But after reading to the end only to have an Alfred Hitchcock non-ending, I was really disappointed. The fact he even warns you in the final pages it will be what his (the main character) dad called a ""conclusion in ambiguity"" or a 'cheap shot' ending, makes it an even bigger slap in the face. The cop out excuse is the reader/listener/watcher is to use their own imagination but that is the whole point of TV, Movies, Books - we are paying the author to give us a story with a beginning, a middle and an ending. If the author can not complete his work and instead leaves it to me, then I should skip his work and do my own - AND I'd the one getting paid.It is one of my pet peeves when an author doesn't give us an ending. Bad, good, sad, happily ever after, give me some sort of an ending."
1,MORE LIES FROM LINDSEY ...,"People, ole Hal Lindsey predicted the world would end in the early 80's in ""Late Great Planet Earth,"" did it? How many more times has he predicted it since then? has it? Where ole Hal is conscerned meditate on Matt 7:21-22, Mark 13:22,1 John 4:1 etc. This is a teaching popular among Evangelical Protestants and asserts that Christians will be miraculaously delivered from the tribulation and that only the ""unsaved"" will suffer under the rule of the Antichrist. The idea that Christians will be ""raptured""-that is, taken up into heaven-before the tribulation is an invention of the ninteenth century. No one in the previous 1800 yrs. of Christian history ever came up with such a notion...Anyone that likes a book like this needs to read (Matthew 25:13)"
1,Don't Buy This Terrible Toy,This is one of the worst toys I have ever ordered. I ordered this because I had Creepy Crawlers as a child. It is not like Creepy Crawlers was in that it is made very poorly. My husband and I spent hours trying to get it to work but it never worked. We realized it is not really made to work well or in our case at all. There is no customer service for this company. I can see why. This is a complete waste of money and I do not think Amazon should not even sell it. I had to throw it out. Of course it was very frustrating for the children when it did not work after hours of trying and attempts to try to find out how to get in touch with customer service.
1,Microscopic font size,"The fonts are so small, my first grader had a hard time reading it due to the font size. I wish I did not buy the book altogether..."
1,Horrible Book,"I don't even know why I bought this book. Its repetitive, poorly written and does not state anything interesting. Don't waste your time or money."
2,runaway,a film that puts on a train what we all know as we hurtle through life. jon voight is the baddest ... of all time -only his luck as ran out as he escapes from a prison onto a runaway train--voight knows its the end of line for him and tries to teach that to eric roberts buts it lost on him as he tries to tell him its all in your mind.. powerful movie with a dark ending thats makes your dollars spent at the theater a treat.
1,Garbage!... Stan Lerner's A bomb on black family...,"Stan... Yes, you have successfully imparted the most horrific stereotypes imaginable against black family... Nothing short of a propagandist A bomb! I don't fully know your motives, but you can't call this transparent mockery art!... This film is simply hateful propaganda worse than that of the early 20th century depictions of black ""life""... I am surprised no-one else has voiced their utter offense to the garbage he portrays as ""family""..."
2,best,"broght for laptop to tv connection, works best, i have previous positive experience for this product, this time i ordered 2 ,, still using it, very good"
2,FANTASTIC !!!,"FANTASTIC !!! Great Stuff !!! I highly recommend this product and this company !!For modeling and game needs, BUY STUFF HERE !!!"
1,a star for every song thats not whack,"Yes. You heard me. Every song on this cd is horrible except ""Dreams"". Do not buy this mainstream garbage. All the good rappers are underground. Listen to them. If you like this, listen to some Murs or Brother Ali and you will see how whack Game really is. Don't buy this garbage. Peace."
2,Pchem,"It's great. It's quite in depth, though you have to accept some parts of the math if you don't already know differential equations.It's understandable even to me, and the last chem course I took was just AP, but it's also very challenging and in depth. Highly recommend."
2,you owe this cd to yourself,It took a while but now I'm finally HERE! and I ain't changing for nothing. this cd is EVERYTHING!! PLEASE make this purchase as the beats take you EVERYWHERE you could want to go!
2,Nummie Children's story,I ordered this book for our grandchildren. Two boys 5 & 3 and a 4 month old girl. All love the story. The mouse is determined.
1,Good for the hard of hearing.,"I have had these for years. I put one next to me at my hearing level. Thus my husband can listen to TV more quietly. For me it is mostly for TV, some music, and occasional movies. It does cut out on some of the old movies -- in the quiet places. There may be better ones out there, but these work for me. Another thing I like is putting them in the kitchen and listening to the news while I am making dinner or doing dishes. It is much clearer then the TV speakers..."
1,Very low level,"Don't waste your time reading this book.About 10% of this book is information worth knowing. The rest is ""packaging material"" ( How the books is organized?, What are we going to do next? and countless repetitions )."
2,Enjoyable and Insightful Autobiography,"Deeply spiritual, cultured, aware and intellectual. Phylis Tickle is a remarkable woman: author, inspiration and story teller.The book is enjoyable as autobiography, history of the mid-south, chronicle of a coming of age in the 1950's, hints of what family means, and a backdrop for someone whose life became a model for millions of modern seekers of a fulfilling spiritual life.This book does not provide the clear path, the blueprint, or the rationale for her career and impact, but it tantalizes the reader with her appreciation of the fullness of life in its many dimensions.If you are seeking the spirit, paused in your spiritual journey or navigating a higher path, this is an enjoyable and insightful work. Phyllis deftly notes the coming impact of Paul Tillich's The Courage to Be (1952) in the last few pages. This book serves as a great summary of one individual's preparation for the next half century of post-existential awareness."
1,Too confusing!,"This is the second Kathy Smith exercise tape I had ever bought. The first was Kathy Smith's Latin Rhythm Workout. I found the steps too complicated which made it unenjoyable so I never used it again after a few tries. But I thought it was just me not picking up on the dance steps. So I gave this dvd a try. Well!! I'm not a total spaz and it takes me time to pick up on certain more complicated moves, but I've been working out with exercise tapes for years so I am familiar with a lot of the steps and timing. But I got confused during the warm-up! Then I knew I was in trouble. I found the cardio portion way too complicated and hard to follow along. When your time is precious and you are trying to squeeze in a workout, it's a waste of time if you are stumbling around confused the entire time. I like Denise Austin's exercise tapes much better."
2,The Best Book I Ever Read,"I saw that the average rating for this book was 4 and a half stars and I had to write a review. This is the best trilogly I have ever read. The plot and story are wonderfully complex. Phillip Pullman is a wonderful author and has written this trilogy magnificantly. I must say that the beginnings are a little slow and dull but hang in there, it's worth it. It also might seem a bit confusing for some but it all comes together. I absolutly love this trilogy. It is hard to put in words my joy when reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone, young or old, which I have. The story only gets better and better with each book. I am just in awe to how Phillip Pullman thought up and wrote this intricate tale. It is filled with so many wonderful surprises and twists it is impossible not to love. Take my advice and read this trilogy, you definitely won't regret it."
1,Look Nice. Sounds Nice. DONT BUY!!!,"Pros. Looks and sounds really nice, but......Cons. Ive had this radio for over 5 years. Like many reviews here the tuner drifts and AM and FM reception is very poor. Ive tried many remidies to no avail. I have an external antenna but its still bad. I only use this radio fro my iPod. Shame"
1,Poor quality,"Don't waste your money. We received these as a gift. After a few months, one of the balls fell apart into huge chucks of plastic. We followed all of the instructions-the product was just cheap and not worth it."
2,Creativity in a Book,"Book has many good ideas and activities for looking at your own creativity. Some of the ideas will be good to try with some ""Fun with Creativity"" groups that Ilead. Like the examples that are shown."
1,Never again,"Bought this in June 2010- uses only a few times. Of course it worked when we used it. Just hung it this year (April 2011)- it was stored in original box for the winter indoors. Yesterday the top pf the unit detached from the zapper causing it to crash onto the patio. The flowtron company will not pay to return it. I am throwing it out and buying another brand. It was great for the couple of months in 2010 that it did work. My husband and I noticed that on either side of the top of the unit- where the screws are, that there was a crack on both sides...hmmm, manufacture defect? Yet they want ME to pay the return shipping! Dont think so! This is in no way a reflection on the seller from amazon- just the flowtron company itself."
1,Cute but Not Much Entertainment,"A friend bought this for my son's first Christmas. He was ten months old and would smile when I shook it to make the noise. Now, at eighteen months, he will hold it for a minute or two if I pass the stick to him, but he quickly loses interest in it.I keep it at my desk at work, though. It makes a great stress reliever!"
2,Mini Cooper cover,"the mini cooper cover is very durable, easy to put on & take off. It fits perfectly & is very elegant."
1,very unhappy,"I expected to recieve a book, not a small pamphlet for $128.00. I had the great grace to have Msgr. Turro as an instructor in seminary and seek anything he has written; but not 24 pages for $128.00!! When contacting the seller, and Amazon to return it, I have not had any response. This is the first time I have ever had any problems returning anything with Amazon. I caution anyone using this seller."
2,Our daughter is so excited to get this guide,"We purchased this guide book for our daughter's Christmas present.She was very excited to get this and she loves this guide book.As long as she is happy with this guide book, we'll be very happy."
2,Excellent Value!,"This battery tender is well worth the price. It took less than 5 minutes to connect to the car and has worked perfectly. When I got it, my battery was not able to start the car, and within a day, it was fully charged. We have had temperatures ranging from the low 60s down to the teens, and the battery tender has maintained the battery fully charged, and the car has been able to start immediately every 2 weeks or so. I highly recommend this battery tender for anyone who has a car stored over long periods of time."
1,A bitter disappointment,"When I started to read through these so called poems, I was appalled by the low standard of Grammar and the inept poetry.I was incredulous as to how such poor literature can be published. It would not surprise me, if on closer inspection, I found out that Kim published this book himself. Whilst the standard of English was poor, the content of these poems was absolutely atrocious i.e. it ranged from anti-Semitic and racist to puerile and nonsensical. Kim's poems present confused and often contradictory messages that, are not helped by the poor English.I would certainly advise prospective readers against this publication. It really is one of the worst poetry books I've ever had the misfortune to read."
2,A great way to relive Olympic memories,A great way to relive Olympic memories. It's hard to remember the stars of past Olympics unless you go back and review these tapes.
2,"My dad says, great for beginners!","I am a veteran juicer, my dad is a brand new juicer. I bought this book for him to get him started and asked him to write his thoughts on. Here is what he said ...""This is well written, easy to read book written by an Australian editor and British licensed nutritionist. It covers everything that a beginning juicer needs to know about equipment, fruit and vegetables. It also provides 60 different recipes. The recipes are for different and varied purposes, such as losing weight, gaining weight, cleansing, detox and even as meal replacements. It also has recipes for children. I would rate this book a good starter book for anyone interested in starting a juicing program."""
2,One of the greatest R&B CD's of the 90's!,"A complete surprise. His voice captures the true emotion of his songs, and draws you into his world. One of my best purchases in quite a while. Well worth every penny I spent on the CD. I reccommend this album to any true R&B fan who's insearch of truly great love songs. ""All that I Am"" is just that song."
1,"Fo Rizzle, and maybe the president will make me secretary","In this tour de force, I only had the urge to vomit twice. Quite possibly, this ""film"" is the most misunderstood gem to come from the Craven camp, which definitely says a lot. Its themes of people living under the stairs and ethnic diversity are a constant [hit] in the face that reminds the viewer to ask him or herself why did he or she pick this movie. Out of all the memorable moments, my personal favorite is the ""father's"" hunting outfit, which is slightly reminiscent of the gimp in pulp fiction. Kudos to Craven on that scary image. In all seriousness, if I learned one thing from this movie it is that some day we all can rise above our oppressors, even if they are incestuous maniacs... especially if you don't watch this movie!"
2,good,"The product is of excellent quality and the price is very attractive, I think you make a good buy, if I have the chance to buy, you can count on to be the first option"
2,Solid Memoir,"Kathy Dobie tells an interesting story of adolesence (and the loss of innocence therein). As a young teen, we find our narrator telling of her final ""acceptance"" in to the world as being wanted sexually, and she hands it over easily. Sadly, the tables turn and she is the victim of a gang rape.The story will certainly capture your attention and the words flow smoothly.However, the narration drags at some points, especially in the first 100 pages, and I found myself wishing she got to the point sooner. Still well worth a read!"
1,Awful!,"This book is very disturbing, badly written, and has bad language (f-bomb even) throughout its pages. It had a very interesting plot at the beginning, but the story goes down hill abruptly. This was a very sick and twisted book, and I was hoping for a fun scary story... Disappointed..."
1,"Great book, poor manufacturing","This was my favorite book as a child and I wanted to share it with my 10-month-old son. It's a great story for kids and every illustration is unique with many different and interesting aspects. The overall material quality, however; is poor. I don't remember that my childhood book was as poorly-made as this one. The trademark gold foil spine is very thin and was peeling off when it arrived. The almost transparently thin pages protrude outside the cheap cardboard covers and the print on some pages is so offset that it almost looks as if the image was meant to be seen through 3D glasses. It's disappointing that an American treasure like Little Golden Books has become a victim of such low-grade manufacturing."
2,Timely,"Pat Buchanan is part commentator and part visionary. Although there is much to disagree with what he says, his tome is well researched and when viewed with an open mind, makes a lot of sense. The difficulty of his proposal is that it is not politically correct. Thus, that is why it is essential reading because he cuts to the core of the problem our country has allowed itself to get into. We should be grateful for patriots like Buchanon who are not afraid to, ""call it as it is""."
2,"Nice price, works well and arrived sooner than expected","After ordering a computer that had a VGA port listed, but didn't have one when it arrived, I ordered this cable to be able to connect my monitor. It was less expensive than what was available in stores with shipping costs and works well. My only challenge was that I had to wait for it to arrive. It did arrive a couple of days sooner than expected. A good deal for a good price."
1,off brand off-camera coiled flash cord for nikon digital cameras,Mechanical assembly of this item is poor. No apparent strain reliefs at either end and small diameter wires. This item did not function properly on my D200 or D70 cameras. Great price but it didn't work. Return to Cameta Camera went smoothly much better than the product did.
1,????What????is????this???????,"I dont know who-or-what possessd The people who made this recording it is T-A-R-I-B-L-E,I really dont see the point of makeing a tribute albem .All I see is takeing really good songs and re-doing them with krapey Instrments- for exsample-(the only instrments thay proble used were A keyboard,and a kareoke Machine)Shakira should be respected she put her hart&sole in writeing and singing these songs and the woman just ruined them. And where did they get those back-up singers-(proble escaping across the border from Mexico and they needed a little extra cash).I would recomend not to buy this albem is was proble put together in 10min.Buy one of Shakira real CD's and dont suport this woman,who ever she is."
1,Essential Art House DVDs don't play,I bought Essential Art House vol. III and it would not play despite being advertised as Region I on my new Toshiba Blu-Ray DVD player.Has anyone had any luck with the other volumes of from Essential Art House?
1,Havent seen the inside or got it,I have not yet to see how it looks like in the inside. Not all products show the inside of a book or baby book. And i would like to look at it before i buy. Even if the other costumers liked it.
2,Janis Joplin - Super Hits (DVD),This item was purchased as a gift and the recipient really liked it. She said it seemed to be a quality product and really liked it!
1,"Poor use of camera, film, sets, script, actors and studio vehicles","This movie was the worse piece of ""erotic-drama"" to come out yet in 2011. It is another example of someone(s) trying to cash in on an idea rather than any sort of plot. The characters are horribly fake and unnecessary, the backdrop is so cheap it's reminiscent of a porn set, and nothing except the possibility of callow erotica exists in this movie to keep any person with real taste watching this rubbish; and I close with a quote from Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever, ""Watching your neighbor's vacation videos might be less painful. May be redeemed by stretches of unintentional amusement."""
2,Great set of tools,"Having a Dremel is worth nothing if you don't have the right attachments to get the job done. I purchased this kit at Wally World to satisfy my need for vengeance. Did I say vengeance? I meant... ummm.. never mind. The savings here is enormous. If I ever run out of anything I'll just buy another one of these and sell off what I don't need, huge profits are to be had,My one suggestion to Dremel is to make the case a little more, well, square. It has to be stored on top of everything else because of the odd shape. Now, the handle, and holes for frequently used attachments is nice and all, but it does get in the way of storing the thing. And having the storage compartments split in two like it is makes it a little awkward to get the tools you need.Either way, this set is perfect for any Dremel owner, you never know when you're going to need one of the twenty or so tools included."
2,Wow. So easy. A lot of heat too.,"Lift it out of the carton and plug it in. Take the remote out of the box, open the battery compartment, and pull out the plastic tab.Look at the back of the stove. Set the tabs for remote control and heat. Wheel adjusts heat. I forgot to push the tab to heat, so I only got the flame effect at first. 5 minutes total installation.Placed in front of my fireplace, on the brick ledge. Flame looks real. A stunner. I can't believe how real it looks. Very strong heat. No wonder the reviews are so good. At this price, if I have to replace it yearly, I'll be happy.I was using ventless gas logs. They do foul the air. The gas logs also cost $ 20 per month for the pilot light, whether I used it or not. Sure the gas logs put out more heat, but who needs that? It overheats one room, and the others are colder. This provides the supplemental heat I need on raw days."
1,Basically it's red curry paste.,"I was hoping for a mix of flavors that would come close to duplicating what many Thai restaurants serve, but unfortunately as far as I can tell this product is little more than red curry paste in an envelope. For a small fraction of the cost you can buy a tub of red curry paste from a popular brand (e.g. Mae Ploy) and achieve the same (or better) results. But why would you? There's more to good thai fried rice than a bit of red curry paste."
1,Readability,This book was very repaticious and difficult to read. I could not finish it. To me it was if someone was trying to show off there vocabulary. The facts were good but the book is just not good reading.
2,My favorite Christmas music,"Having seen the original TV production of Amahl as a kid, I have very fond and tender memories of this story, and I find the music to be absolutely delightful - profound but in a very accessible and somewhat playful way. This recording brings back the spirit of Christmas to me instantly!"
2,A 12-year old can handle it!,"All I have to say is my young daughter got it from me as a Christmas gift. She needed help with the first time she transferred music onto it. After that, I haven't heard a peep as to ""I don't know how to..."" do whatever with the thing. That, to someone such as myself, who is still completely challenged in the area of mp3, deserves a great rating."
2,"An absolute ""must-see"" for practitioners of Buddhism","10 Questions for the Dalai Lama is an award-winning documentary DVD of ten soul-searching questions posed to His Holiness the Dalai Lama by filmmaker and explorer Rick Ray. Among the profound questions asked are ""Why do the poor often seem happier than the rich?"", ""Must a society lose its traditions in order to move into the future?"", and ""How do you reconcile a commitment to non-violence when faced with violence?"" Bonus features include an interview with the director, additional selected scenes, and an interview with Tenzin Geyche Tethong. An absolute ""must-see"" for practitioners of Buddhism, worthy of the highest recommendation for its thoughtful examination of both earthly and transcendental issues. 85 minutes, closed-captioned, color."
1,"Misleading advertisement, missing plastic carrying container",I did not get the item as advertised. The advertised product clearly states and shows a picture of a hard plastic carrying case. What has received was a flimsy cloth carrying bag. I am satisfied with the sander but the product clearly was not what was advertised.
2,an adventure all nighter,"Of all the 3rd edition adventures, i must say this is simply the best!I just got this book and it kept the players wide awake all night long.The enemy encounters are real challenging and you should be well prepared.The plots, items, spells, and new templets are great.This will get you WAY up after you have finished.This book, its worth EVERY cent!regards,A satisfied costumer"
1,Spend more $ for something that works,Save your money. This product is junk. You cant even tell which side is 120 or 240 grit. When you rub your hand over the stone it just crumbles. When you run your knife over the stone it crumbles. This product is already in the trash after one week of use. very disappointing.
2,Fine product,"We used this for over 8 months and had no problem with it. There was no drying despite several days between uses. I wish the cost was lower, of course! However, the colors were satisfactory and we even printed photos."
2,TropiShade Outdoor Umbrella,We were amazed at the value of this product. And the shipping was phenomanol! This was pre-Christmas weekend and it came in 3 days. Unfortunately it will be a couple of months before we can actually sit under it and enjoy the shade. The color is perfect with our cushions and natural wood furniture
2,Excellent and informative book,"This is an excellent book which explains many facets of healthy eating & living. I buy a lot of Jordan Rubin's Garden of Life products because they are high quality and real. There are people that put down Jordan's products but they are usually the mainstream medical profession that want to keep you sick. It's like the old saying ""There's no money in the CURE""..The medical community wants to keep you sick so they can stay wealthy..Sincerely,Bill Morin[...]."
1,Did not have a chance....,"I did not have a chance to see whether it performed well or not, because it worked only for about 15 minutes.... While the turn-table is still working, the mixer is dead...."
2,"A little Respect, Please... Don`t compare these movies.","When you ""compare"" Ridley scott`s Alien and Cameron`s Aliens, you should notice the age when both Pictures were realized and how Cameron took advantage of the Special Efects (more advanced only 7 years later), the creatures, the plot , the story, and etc. Ridley Scott`s Alien is a more complex, pasive, more character development, and a Superb realization from any viewing point. Cameron`s Aliens is more a top-notch action, adrenalizer, and eye candy effects. I preffer personally the original, Alien, it has a much more development, i think the plot in Cameron`s Aliens is very weak because many of the things that it shows i`ve seen it in the original. But the movie you preffer realize that both movies are completly differents, while Scott`s Alien is made to make you having nightmares, Cameron`s Aliens is to have you at the edge of the seat."
1,Won't work in some older homes!,"We have an 85-year old home with original beautiful plaster walls and wonderful large mouldings. The Bumper Jumper (which I really wanted to use!!) wouldn't fit as the directions described, due to the clamp-like structure at the top being too small to fit over the top of the tall mouldings. Plus, our plaster walls are wider than the 3"" limit allowed safely by this toy. Too bad they don't make the top clamp taller or at least adjustable."
1,love the pattern-product not so much,"I saw these and had to have them and purchased two. Sadly, with normal, ordinary use both broke in several pieces not long after putting them into use. I have to say I was very disappointed. This is not the first of this product I have bought to use in my car's cupholders and I am not careless with their use. I can see one breaking, but both broke within a day of each other."
1,Please rent it before buying.,"I was expecting a PS2 game, but I got something that looks like it should be played on an Atari 2600. Even PS1 games leave this one in the dust. Instead of Gradius III & IV, I would reccommend G Darius (PS1). Even though it's an older game, it is way better than than this embarrassment."
2,A rechargeable 9V battery that lives up to its name,"This Energizer Rechargeable battery not only lives up to its name but exceeds its expectations despite the previous reviewer's uninformative piece. Although this battery is rated at only 150mAh, it actually produces 184mAh which is over 122% of the actual capacity claim from the manufacturer! This result has been obtained by a test done by Rechargeable-Battery-Review.com back in 2007. Energizer has now come up with a 175mAh version which has not only more capacity but works well with the Energizer Family Charger. I have used this product for my wireless Shure microphone and it is more than sufficient. Now that the 150mAh has a huge discount, one should pick up more of these. This product is highly recommended."
2,Glen Campbell--Cristmas...Country Style,"Glen Campbell has always been one of my all-time favorites, from Witchita Line to Country Boy, and his Christmas songs are no exception. Of all the Christmas songs, which Glen did during the height of his career, the song ""Christmas Day"" rises above the rest, for this classic is a reminder of how Christmas used to be. Joe Scalise."
2,A Very Good Debut Album,"Not counting ""I Can't Wait"" and the Lizzie McGuire Movie soundtrack, this is Hilary Duff's first CD, and boy, is it a doozie!I bought this not expecting much, to be honest. I expected mostly ballads and lots of Disney-ish, Kidz Bop-esque music. To my surprise, I was greeted with mostly upbeat songs, well-written lyrics, and great music.""Come Clean,"" ""Workin' It Out,"" ""Party Up,"" and ""Metamorphosis"" are good examples of the best this album has to offer, and hopefully what more will come from Miss Duff in the future. There are a few close misses (""The Math,"" ""Little Voice""), but all in all this is a good album for a debut.I expect only good things from Hilary in the future, and I'm expecting to see more writing credits from her on her sophomore release (her only writing credit in this album was in ""Metamorphosis,"" with the other two H. Duff credits being her sister Haylie's ""Sweet Sixteen"" and ""Inner Strength"")."
1,A Slogan without Substance,"A great academic study, but business people won't find this book very useful because its main theme (Forget, Borrow, Learn) is too vague to apply. The book doesn't tell you what to forget, what to borrow or what to learn. Nor does it provide any guidance on how to figure out what to forget, borrow or learn. So, as a senior executive, I haven't got any idea about what to do with my firm."
2,Cyber Acoustics AC-201 Stereo Headset/microphone,This product is an excellent value. The sound quality is very good and the headset is very comfortable.
1,Not very good,"I bought this at Walgreens a year ago. I wish I hadn't. The humidifier seems OK at first with the mentol because you can easily detect menthol. But really this isn't doing much at all. It doesn't push moisture in the air whatsoever when my Sunbeam did. The difference was that you can feel the water on the Sunbeam, and on the Halls version you couldn't. This means that all your getting is a menthol treatment that you could easily get from a cough drop or two. Not recommended unless you just have a cough, not a cold."
1,Ripoff,"Universal could, of course, have put both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 on the same disc (22 songs total). And music companies wonder why CD sales are down/illegal downloads are up. Universal isn't the only offender in the cheapskate sweepstakes, but it certainly leads the pack. Great artists, and great music, done in by greed. Very sad."
1,strap is crap,"Should have read the reviews. But since my husband was happy with his Timex Ironman, I thought I'd try one too. After only 6 months of use ( and only on weekends), the watch part popped out of the strap support, and just doesn't stay in place when you try to hook it back in. The watch may keep on ticking, but the strap is useless, effectively making the whole watch useless."
1,The worst end for a bad begginng,"I loved all of the books in the 'Series of Unfortunate Events' exect for the seventh and this one. I don't understand how an author can write books that are so good and keep your attention and then with the last book in the series of 11 loose all of it.And if that was the last book then I think that was the worst ending that he could have written... but on the other hand if there is going to be another book I don't know if I'll be reading it.Sorry if this disappoints you but this is a word of caution... listen to him when he tells you to put the book down, it will be your only hope."
2,Superb,One of the easiest to read books for social work practice with clients. It was very enjoyable to read and very practical for anyone studying clinical social work on a graduate level.
1,Garbage,Patrick Robinson has really dredged the depths. He repeats his court martial scenerio of a single submarine (remember the president's son in previous books) as the climax of a plot that has china invading taiwan - give me a break! Poorly researched (Qantas is NOT spelt Quantas) and an insult to Australians (we do not say cobber all of the time) Definately the last time I will waste my time on this author
2,So Good!,"This is such a great album the twins are gorgeous their cute songs are just what you need to brighten up your day. I especially like I am The Cute One, We Love To Scream and Brocolli and Chocolate. If your thinking of buying this album, do. It is great. It would probably be the Olsen's best album. Thanks"
2,Koyaanisqatsi,"Listen to this album while watching Koyaanisqatsi.Start the CD just as the red letters of the title appear, sit back and enjoy. Tell me this CD wasn't destined to be the soundtrack to this wonderful movie..."
1,"Product fine, vendor misleading practices","I have no complaints about this product, but I refuse to buy it from any vendor (in this case ChiTek, but apparently there are others) who advertise a low price but then charge your 3X what they should for shipping. I tried to order $10 worth of memory cards, and after filling out all the necessary ordering information, I'm informed on the last page that they were charging $19.95 shipping for about 3 ounces of product. The final price was typical, but I'd much rather buy it direct from Amazon or another vendor that does not follow these arguably sleazy practices. I hope you do to. Be aware."
2,Dirt Bugs,"Got this book for my brother in-law, he's thinking about building a ""dirt bug"" not many dunes in southwest Texas; so it's a bit of a stretch calling it a dune buggy."
1,This is just wrong,"Get Ace and Peter back, and get rid of those two clowns that are wearing there make up, and you will have a real KISS dvd. Enough said!!"
1,Not so great,"My son is addicted to vacuums and I was excited to buy this one because it makes noise and has the cyclone action. But, it isn't made very well. The front peice falls off constantly and the plastic isn't very durable. He still loves it, but it is a hassle for me because he gets frustrated with it."
1,Surprised at the good reviews.,I bought this at Whole Foods hoping it would work. It doesn't. I can't even imagine how they can claim that it thickens anything. I have really fine hair and all it does is make my hair look greasy. I use a seriously tiny amount...barely visible on my fingers. It neither makes my hair look thicker nor holds any kind of shape at all. I guess I'm still on the lookout for a good natural thickener. It bums me out to throw it away but I guess I'm going to.
1,Bad Merchandise,This product did not work less than poor money wasted what replacement. And have been trying to contact seller with no help.Don
1,The Witches of Eastwick/VHS,"This was the first and only thing I have ever received that I had issues with. I ordered the movie I ordered it in DVD, not VHS. And when it arrived it was VHS. The tape in the VHS was ripped out of the tape itself and all internal parts were broken. You could shake it and hear all the parts shaking around. But, like I said, that was the first and only bad item I have ever received from Amazon.com."
1,What a bummer!,I am also a fan of Becky Kelly and have bought the calendars in the past with the beautiful ribbons. I was disappointed when I got this year's calendar. It didn't have any ribbon to tie and there were very noticeable glue spots that had stained not only the pictures themselves but the each of month pages as well.
1,Poor quality and design,"The black ink works after just 18 months, cleaning many times, try ahcohol to clean it, still not working ,had to throw whole set away, very bad product, I will never buy any Brother product again.The design is that when any ink run out, you can not do anyting, and even you do not use, the ink dry itself, (it cleaning every few days by itself, using your inks)."
2,A modern tale of piracy and justice,"I really discovered a gem. It could have been a simple case of piracy, but things in the real world are rarely that simple. Mr. Setlowe has managed to mix a cauldron of piracy, espionage, fanaticism and the right man in the wrong place. Captain Henry Stewart sails his guided missile frigate into harm's way. He spent his youth aboard riverine units in the Mekong Delta, and he understands the fight better than the admirals in Washington.This is a great, great read!"
1,Just O.K.,"I use Irish Cream bended with two other coffees and found this one to be overpowering. I also do not enjoy the smell, as grounds or when percolated. The tate is not so bad that I will not finish off what I have, but I will not be purchasing this brand again."
1,Get an editor,"Sometimes I read excerpts of books that sound ridiculous, just for fun. However, when the syntax is grade-school level, the logic non-existent, and spelling and grammar are butchered in the first few pages alone, amusement turns to pity. Who turned this poor book loose without an editor?"
2,The best dessert cookbook ever!,"This is the best collection of dessert recipes I have ever seen, and I collect cookbooks. Wish I was one of those who never gain weight...I would make a different recipe from this book every week! :)"
1,product didnt work right and company wouldnt back it up,Wouldnt buy from this bunch again. The product was given as a gift. My son took it home first week of January when their Christmas visit was over. Couldnt get the scribing process to work. Was told to contact the manufacturers to fix the problem which he did and they couldnt fix. Then he tried to return via Amazons instructions and after hassling with that was told only the original purchaser could return it and so he asks me to see about it. I am told when I contact antonline that its been to long (january 22nd) to return the merchandise. Most responsible companies extended their return deadlines for Christmas and some dont even have one. Wont do business with manufacturer or Antonline again. Having problems with other amazon merchant returns too and may stop using amazon all together except that I use their credit card alot. Guess that can be changed too.
2,"not bad, not great, but okay","after listening to janet's new cd 'all for you,' three things come to mind. she's single and having fun, she's horny, she still sounds the same (she could have just named it velvet rope II or something like that). the cd has it's mix of upbeat dance songs ('come on get up' & 'someone to call my lover'), smooth r&b ('feels so right'), sexy slow jams ('would you mind' & 'love scene'), and bonafide pop hits ('doesn't really matter,' 'all for you'). it has it's highs and its lows, but her collaboration with carly simon on 'son of a gun,' isn't nearly as ad as some of the reviews here have said. personal favorites include (other than the two already released):'feels so right' - classic janet with a perfect fusion of r&b/pop.'when we ooo' - reminiscent of 'love will never do,' (and they rhyme too), probably what she had in mind.'better days' - testimonial on life experience and lessons learned."
1,More Hollywood blah ...,"This movie consists of a long series of shot-em-up scenes from start to finish. Pretty much the same bunch of good guys slugging it out with the same bad guys every scene. Not much of a plot. OK there is the mandatory pretty girl, not much else going on. The original was a clever movie for its time, and much better.Only reason to give it 2 stars is that the technical work on CGI was very good."
2,Don't miss it,"If you admire the warmth and humanity of Helen Levitt's endearing photographs of New Yorkers, don't miss this book. The selection of photographs is superb and the printing and binding quality are first rate. This book could go out of print soon, from which time its value will grow quickly."
1,Poorly Written Hype,"This is one of the silliest books I've ever read. First, whoever Joyce Reardon is, he/she should research the type of writing a post-Victorian woman would have written before they try to mock-up such a piece of lurid fiction. This book is no better than a Harlequin romance with a couple of paranormal events thrown in. Steven King may have written this, but in that case, he's no better at satire (if that's what he's attempting) than he is at horror fiction. Save your money and your intelligence."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I realize Mr. Halberstam edited this book and wrote only one one its many essays. Nevertheless, his name is on the cover and he receives royalties (I assume)so he has to be taken to task. Obviously I expect far, far better from Mr. Halberstram. Of the many essays in the book from a wide range of writers, only a couple are even worthy of reading. A definite skip - don't waste your time."
2,AWESOME!,"I have been wanting this movie because of Grace Jones for so long and could never find it by itself until recently. It is always tucked in with a boxed set of James Bond movies for a hefty price. Excellent movie, and Grace Jones is superb!"
2,"Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to Gods, Goddesses, and Traditional Ancient Egypt",I enjoyed the content of the book but would have liked more pictures of gods & goddesses. I wanted to be able to identify them on temple & tomb walls in Egypt. I felt it gave me a solid foundation in Egyptian mythology though.
1,Returning this c.d. came NATURALLY to me !!!,"As a long-time Sheena fan, this is probably one of her worst! Sheena has such vocal talent that she really doesn't need to stoop to this level of noise pollution like she did with ""The Lover In Me."" Thank God she is once again singing beautiful songs that her voice was meant to sing like her ""No Strings"" c.d."
2,Great comfort,"These fit great and breath very well. they are definetly worth buying. however the only thing i dont like is that they were a rather expensive. $16.00 for just one pair is rather high, it would be better if these came in pairs of 3 for so much money."
1,Flame Out,It would be a nice torch if it would light and stay lit. The only way this torch would light was to hold the tip close to a non-combustable surface & push the light button. As soon as it was moved away from the lighting position the torch would go out. Returned product & went back to more expensive and reliable Bernzomatic. Reliability trumps expense every time.
1,A very boring book,"I've been reading a lot of Vietnam first-hand reports and have found them all to be absolutly mesmerizing, but not this one.I only read about four chapters before i gave up. It was the most boring book i have read in a very long time. In those first four chapters the only thing approaching excitement was a trip into the jungle with an informant who said he knew where there the VC were. When they got off of the helicopter the author fell in a puddle up to his neck and they then found a lot of booby traps so the informant got cold feet so they went home. That's it. Not a shot fired.I'm going to try to return it."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Vito Corleone is the Godfather, and his last name is also the name of a small town in Italy. The book looks at the development of the mafia in America, and the Godfather's upbringing and rise to power.An important part of this is that one of the important members of his crime family, Tom Hagen, is not of his immediate family, or Italian, and this drives some major conflict."
2,unique instruments and sounds,I don't think there is anything like the music of Riverdance. It stands alone and is wonderful. It aids the imagination in going to far away places in far away times.
1,Not good.,"I liked the original much better. I never liked Jamie Lee Curtis. Lindsey whatever her name is doesn't hold a candle to Jodie Foster, and no, I am not just saying that the old one is better b/c it came out when I was a girl and I like to live in the past, I'm 18. So that's saying something"
2,sassy flower pop up,"I really enjoy it, and it very colorful, I will buy from this seller again thanks"
2,50 Years of Hits - George Jones,The three CDs of 50 years of George Jones' hits is an excellent portrayal of the man and his songs. Each song represents a story in his life through good times and bad. A great set of songs to add to the classic country music collector's library.
1,For diehardcore completists only!,"Been there, done that! All this CD is is a reissue of ""Decade"", the first greatest hits collection from 1989. They have the exact same tracks. If you're more a--l-retentive about getting imports than me, be my guest and buy this. Otherwise, there's the singles box coimng in June with some tracks never officially released on CD, and even better, the classic line-up's reunion (I know it's not the original, they too have had what I call Destiny's Child Syndrome!) later this year."
2,Great tool organizer,"I really like these things. I wish they were a couple of bucks cheaper, but their damn handy. They're a little heavier than you might expect."
1,Insert Doesn't Fit!!!,"I own a Delta 10"" Professional model table saw. One of the first and most necessary accessories I bought was a dado blade which entailed buying the table insert. After double checking model numbers, etc. to make sure I was buying the right thing, I got it home and it didn't fit. I had to use my angle grinder and quite a bit of time to make it fit. The insert works great now, but it was extremely frustrating having to ""custom fit"" it to my table saw, especially when the model number was supposed to fit properly."
2,Don Camilo,"Este libro lo leí por primera vez apenas de 10 años, desde entonces lo he leído incontables veces. El ejemplo de humanidad en el termino de nobleza se refleja aun en medio de tantas contradicciones, entre dos grandes amigos en privado y enemigos publicos. Nos regala una gran imagen de como se es capaz de vivir aun en paz aun en medio de las grandes contradicciones ideológicas, y aun mas, como gozar de la vida en hermandad con opiniones políticas, religiosas y sociales tan extremas en oposición. Este es un libro que ha significado tanto, en mi vida y en mi formación humana, que ha sido un libro que he comprado para regalar a mis amistades."
1,too noisy for the price,"I thought this item was very cool to watch........ if I was deaf or didnt have ears! It is very noisy! It kind of ruins the cool effects of the mesmerizing water swirling around and changing colors. After spending so much on it with the shipping costs I guess I expected more, but the noise forces me to give it only 2 stars...."
1,OK BUT NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR TIME,"We bought this cart after our daughter was born it holds plenty but it leans and bends in places. Again this product is ok for a little while but not long we are looking into replacing it soon and we have only had it a few months. Its only good for a short period of time then I would look for something else, we regret buying it now though."
1,Not accurate - Cpmplete Disappointment,"This laptop is a big disappointment for me. As a parent of a 4 year old I find this a poor choice at any age. The keyboard has the letters ordered across in alphabetical order, not as real keyboards are. This I strongly feel is going to confuse children of 3 years or up for their future use of computers. This perhaps is okay for children 18 months to no older than 36 months. Mouse also is not accurate but works. The graphics are very poor as others stated and difficult to see since not lit at all. Even the audio is poor. It is garbled enough that we cannot determine if the man said c,e,b or d because you it all sounds the same just something eeee. Cannot tell if it is bah eee, da eee, sss eee etc.Not something I would recommend for child of any age."
1,BRANDI?,Were you ever molested as a child?You definately have some issues to come up with this topic! Please- do us all a favor and don't write another book. Please seek professional help!
1,Waste Of Time,"To say I was disappointed with this book would be an understatement in the extreme. I feel cheated, not only out of the dollars that I paid out for this dross, but also out of the time I spent sitting reading it, when I could have been doing something more productive. In fact anything would be more productive than reading this. I'm not saying this book is totally useless, you could use it to line a cat box, but if your thinking of buying it to read, save your money. Any book would be a better read than this one."
1,Not very effective,It doesn't really keep your beverage cool. It also lacks an on/off switch. A foolish gadget that's a waste of money.
2,"good resource to learn or refresh your ADABAS, NATURAL or ADASQL","I bought this eons ago and lost it and with the economy and computer field shaky I bought this used since WHO&O; wanted top dollar for it I looked here instead....Hard to find publications pertaining to ADABAS database which is more widely used in Europe, etc."
1,Boring and pretentious . . .,"I have forced myself to read over half of this novel and am going to have to give up. Diane Johnson's writing style tries too hard to be clever and ends up sounding silly and pretentious. Her characters are two-dimensional and dull and what little plot developed early on surrounding a mysterious murder just about disappeared halfway through the book. I have not read ""Le Divorce,"" but based on other reviews here, I will give it a try. It can only be better than this mediocre novel."
1,Waste of money...,"You will not get my money New Line. I have already the EE DVD version, and it still worths the 40$ I've paid for.What is new in this cheap blu-ray package ? Nothing! Even the features will be on SD format. What a skinflints!!"
2,Looks great in my bathroom!,"The style is delightfully art-deco, and the chrome finish goes great with my pink-and-gray bathroom. I mounted it where I can reach it from both my toilet and tub. The redial doesn't work, but I don't really need that feature. I turned the bell off because my rotary phones make it ring when I dial them, but this is not the first phone I've had with that quirk. Overall, it's really nice."
1,Look for another book!,"After reading about half of Mr. Kern's book, I found myself wondering if the purpose of this book was less about helping others aquire self-discipline and more about giving Mr. Kern an opportunity to 'toot-his-own-horn'. while I do agree with his '6 steps' and believe in the value of setting goals, not comparing yourself to others, etc., I did not find any advise from Mr. Kern as to how to accomplish these things in my life. This is not to mention the some what poor organization of the book and general lack of interesting material!After struggling to finishing the whole book, I highly recommend buying something else!"
2,Fantastic chairs!,These chairs are beautiful and very sturdy for folding chairs. They arrived assembled and packed well. Great chairs. I would recommend them to anyone looking for an upgrade to the awful metal folding chairs.
1,Why Bother,"I purchased this cable because I was interested in wireless internet connection. My local ISP only pulled in at about 14kbps and I was looking for a reason to drop my wireline connection anyway.I only have one thing to say. SLOW!!! It only pulls 9.6kbps max. This was confirmed by Cingular's customer service. If you are looking for wireless internet, this is not the way to go."
2,evans resonate side,"Sounds good so far even with old batter head. It has a nice sound even without the batter side on. One could use as the batter side, but it would not last long. Nice coating as well."
1,"stupid, offensive","It's hard to describe how stupid and offensive this book is.The heroine keeps saying that she wants to prove to her family and friends that she's smart and capable, then she acts like an idiot.The hero is offensive. He's the kind of person who, in a different era, would be groping women on the subway.I kept reading, hoping it would improve, but stopped and returned it when just got intolerable."
1,Garbage,I didn't even make it through the first ten minutes...acting was bad and there was a low budget feel to it.
1,"Good reviews, bad bad music.","This album was heralded by Pitchfork. I thought I was in for something phenomenal and captivating. I found nary. Sure the songs are musically shound and the instruments are interesting, but it's nothing that grabs you nor does it make you want to listen to it again. I can't help but feel the singer is often off-key. If you don't like high whiney voices, you definetly don't want this. To conclude, it's good enough music, but what good is it if you don't want to listen to it more than once."
1,"Great Features, Poorly built","Bought the Yepp 700 online exactly a year ago, and it is now broken. The battery case will not shut. (This has happened to many other customers. BUYER BEWARE.)However, the mp3 player does have nice features.-Good Sized Memory256 mb is alot of storage. You can get about 70 songs with that. Buy the media card. It's cheap.-Slick lookingThe yepp is very nice looking. It is also pretty small. Good to exercise with.-Remote controlIts nice that they put this here, but it is pretty worthless. The LCD is wothless, and the FM tuner on this is EXTREMELY WEAK!- Voice RecorderGood feature.In summary, nice features, but poorly built. If you want to take a chance on the mp3 player, go right ahead."
2,A bawdy canine riot !,"I thought this was going to be some refined story of the Bard through the eyes of his dog. Instead, I got a randy romp of domestic fights and love, told in ""canine Elizebethan"" form. Wow what fun ! Some of the lines Mr Hooker (Bill's dog) I still like to use. This is a fun book"
1,Ugh! What IS this?,"Like most of the other reviewers I really enjoyed ""The Nanny Diaries,"" and ""Citizen Girl"" really fell short of my expectations. I am a fast reader but I honestly had to force myself to finish this book just because I can't stand to have read part of a book. Now I wish I hadn't. It's hard to ever start caring about ""Girl."" The generic naming of everything was a bit over the top. So much of it seems ridiculously far fetched. I understand it's satire, but it's so poorly written that it doesn't work. No matter how much you like ""The Nanny Diaries,"" don't waste your time on this!"
2,Fascinating,"I would have to recommend this movie to people who enjoy atypical yet thought-provoking movies. It is different and not for people not willing to think outside the box. This is a movie about friendship, love, loss, sadness, and the general simplicities in life that are usually over looked. This movie was definitely sad and also made me happy. I enjoyed the many meaningful messages presented throughout the movie. There are many great quotes and provides a different view of how life can be perceived and how life is changing. At most, I would say this movie provides a wonderful message about friendship. A genuine friendship that is rare today. You can do many fancy things to prove you are ""best friends,"" but does your friendship provide you a sense of hope and inspiration? ""You are my best friend. You are my only friend."" One person can make a difference in a persons life, as Mary and Max had did for one another."
1,RETURNED READ THE WARININGS!,"Returned after reading reviews and consulted our veternarian. . I have returned this due to the hazards they warn about this probuct. It causes teeth to break off in the dogs mouth., They are to hard for them to chew. They create sores. PLEASE CHECK AND DO YOU OWN HOMEWORK BEFORE YOU BUY.Will save you vet bills and a painful pet if you check the cons about this product."
2,Surprisingly entertaining,"First, don't be put off by the quality of the film. Some of the subtitle conversation is washed out in the lighter backgrounds but not much. The story is still understandable.So, this master swordsman's son is given a mission by his father to deliver a box. He is met by bandits along the way and ultimately injured. He is rescued by a young girl who is also a master with the sword and kung fu. The box is delivered. While he is away on his mission, his family is killed and he races home to exact revenge. There is something more to this story. I won't give it all away. Watch it. You won't be disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"One of my favorite things about christmas when I was young was watching Rudolph and the Island of Misfit Toys on the television. So, when I say that it had been released I bought it. As soon as I watched it, I was EXTREMELY disappointed. They replaced the lovable stop-motion classic with a low-rent computer animation. Not only is it not stop motion anymore but the animation is horrible. Maybe if it resembled something like Toy Story it would be more entertaining but the rendering of the animation was so simple that i felt like I was watching something that a beginning animation student made. If you enjoyed the original Rudolph then don't buy this becuase you will just be disappointed."
1,Snobbery,"No one in Shakespeare's lifetime, or the first two hundred years after his death, expressed the slightest doubt about his authorship. The ""authorship controversy"" only started when Shakespeare's plays were translated into other languages and European writers started to describe Shakespeare as a genius and a rival to Homer and the ancients. Academics then scooted off to Warwickshire to look for relics but came back embarrassed - Homer's English rival was the son of a glovemaker who had never even been to university.That's when theorists started proposing various aristocrats as alternative authors (the Earl of Shrewsbury, the Earl of Derby, the Earl of Oxford, etc, etc, etc). At the root of all these ridiculous theories there is nothing but snobbery. These ""Oxfordians"" just don't like the idea that the greatest writer of all time was a common man of the people."
2,I've been living on chocolate ice-cream,"Dramarama's unterestimated and underrated brilliance stuns me. They are the masters of dreamy, wistful and sad. While this album does, indeed, provide just a slice of the Dramarama experience (check out ETC, on the first album, for example- it really should have made it on to the Best Of), it is a fairly meaty slice and a reasonably satisfying one."
1,It's Mr. Ruben Sellout Studdard,"I'm not a big fan of R&B, so I guess I couldn't be expected to like this album. And I can't stand rap; I despise it with all my heart and soul. So you can imagine how I would cringe when I heard some of the rap-like selections on this CD.But I bought it because my daughter and I liked Ruben on American Idle. His renditions of mainstream songs, like Superstar and How Can You Mend a Broken Heart are pretty good. It's the other poor excuse for music on the CD that I really despise.My daugher listened to the CD once through and gave it back to me, saying she didn't want this piece of trash in her collection. So I gave it a listen and decided there was no room in my collection either. So I guess I'll try to sell it to some poor soul who actually likes this garbage."
2,Great when it works,"Easy installation and it runs better than my old Windows machine. However, I have a brand new Mac and it is quriky about opening, sometimes refusing for several tries. Overall, it makes the Windows on Mac experience just great."
2,solid gaiters,I bought these for my kili climb...they are well made and did what they are supposed to do. The only annoyance is that they trap moisture...not sure if there are gaiters that don't.
1,All-Clad Stainless Steamer with Lid,"I was disappointed with this product because of the quantity of food that it accomodates. Steam holes do not cover the entire bottom of this steamer and food may scorch when not placed directly over the steam holes. Food can only be placed toward the bottom center of the steamer over the steam holes to prevent scorching. I have another stainless steamer that I prefer because steam holes cover the entire bottom of the steamer. However, this steamer is o.k. for steaming a smaller amount of food where all of the food fits over the steam holes in the center bottom of the steamer."
1,Innocent and Despairing,"OK, so the music teacher didn't really know what he was supposed to be teaching, the kids just sang what they wanted, a few instruments were provided, the recording facilities were rudimentary and...BIG HIT, GREAT SENSATION etc. etc. I got the album for Christmas and knew nothing about this supposed phenomenon as I live on another continent. Reading the blurbs, I got quite enthusiastic but listening was another story. Not exactly recommended music to digest your Christmas dinner! My son pleaded with me to turn it off, the dog left the room and I was left wincing. They call this ""outsider music"" because if you play it inside you do so at your own risk. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's good. And, it's not particularly old, either. It's pretty awful."
1,zip a dee doo DUD!,This tape is good and we all love the songs but the tape is only 15 minutes long...kind of a dud really....thank you...
1,Poor Backlight,Watch has very poor display in the night - Used watch for 2 years - the battery works but the watch stopped working.
2,Not the Typical Schlock,"Sure, the dubbing is off but for me it added to the movie. It's a great combination of eery and camp with arguably the most effective soundtrack I've ever heard. Turn out the lights and enjoy!"
2,the best bed frame!,"I got this bed frame because I was looking for an economical bed, that was high for storage and that could be set up in an ""L"" shape when I wanted to use the guest room as a den. After looking and looking at bed and matress places I found this online and sight un seen ordered 2 hesitantly. They are perfect! Great price, sturdy as a rock easy to set up, versitile no need to buy a box spring room under the bed for storage. Great product. I'd never buy a metal frame again. I'm surprized they don't cary these in mattress stors, or even the unfined furniture store that I tried. Hats off to this company for making a good solid all wood product, just like the good old days. Thanks."
2,"If you weren't a Santana fan before, you will be now!",Music just doesn't get any better than this! Rob Thomas and Santana were meant to play together! Best CD I've purchased in quite some time.
1,one of the worst science fiction books I have read,You would expect that a science fiction writer writing about future would spend time to know some of the basic technology of today. Mr. Clarke seems to write about future as if technology of the first half of the 20th century is yet to happen in the future. Furthermore he displays a profound lack of understanding of general principles of science. Blend that with general lack of imagination and you make for an utter waste of time which is how rate the time I spent reading the Rama series. I wonder what the critics were thinking when they awarded this book same awards as Asimov and Herbert.Adnan A. Khan
1,"Just Misery...Know Sula, No Peace...","SULA, I don't know why folks have been saying this book was hard to read, I read it in 2 days, while watching basketball play-offs! It was not difficult at all. This is the 2nd book by Morrison I've read, the other was THE BLUEST EYE. I don't like Morrison and she is not so great a writer to me. I don't understand how people reviewing this book could say it was a ""masterpiece"" or ""so meaningful to me""! It was about a dysfunctional family, hell a dysfunctional town. I don't get how this could be ""the best I've read"". Hell, it was depressing and Sula Peace had no peace at all. I really felt sorry for Nel because she befriended such a s.o.b. as Sula. I'd hate to have her as my only friend. Generation after generation was off from Eva, to Hannah, to Sula! Pick up a book that has some happiness about it instead of this.Just my 2 cents!"
1,Damaged Item,"I ordered two of these babies. When I opened the package, it was obvious that one of the Pots was broken. And sure enough, when I opened the one Pot up, it was shattered in pieces. Overall, they work great. You are better off just going to Walmart and buying it there though. That way you don't have to worry about getting a damaged item."
1,I really didn't like it,"I had a little shipping problem(no fault of the seller) and waited a long time for this ring. I was disappointed when I opened the box. It looks cheap to me. The setting for the stone is cheapo...not the band, but the metal the stone is actually set in. I've had it 2 years and have only worn it twice. It may work for a teenager. The band itself is nice and the stone size is small, just the way I wanted it. It has never tarnished. I know it was inexpensive, but it looks that way too....at least to me. Gem Avenue does sell some of the best snake chains I have ever seen in sterling. They are very durable and require little cleaning and they do not tarnish...period. I had mine for 2 years and wear them often. They are inexpensive, but very well made and good looking."
1,don't bother with this product,was really looking forward to using this trimmer for a hibiscus hedge and to trim some bouganvillas. wanted it to work. it seemed like it would jamb on very little and not even close to the size of material that the manufacturer claims it will cut. then when you clear everything you can see it still won't run and the motor just hums. used it for about an hour and just sent it back. guess i should have just got a gasoline trimmer instead. but i gotta say that i sure love amazon!
2,Issues #37-#43 of the Vaughan/Guerra series,"This trade paperback collects issues #37-42 of the excellent DC Comics series. Series co-creator Pia Guerra pencils the three-issue ""Paper Dolls"" story arc. Yorick and Agent 355 spend a day in decaying Sydney, Australia, searching for Beth but instead running afoul of a zealous tabloid reporter. Meanwhile, Dr. Mann bonds with an Australian who may or may not still be a spy and the Israeli soldiers reappear with Yorick's mother in Washington, DC.Goran Sudzuka pencils the remaining three issues. The subpar #40 centers on Hero and Yorick's other Beth while the excellent #41 is chiefly backstory on Agent 355. #42 focuses on Yorick's monkey Ampersand who may have the cure for the plague. I enjoyed this book, though not as much as some of the earlier ones: I'm looking forward to Book 8."
2,My grandson will be so excited!,My 4 year old grandson is a animal expert. He watches Nat Geo films all the time. He has a book that shows a Red Panda. It is very hard to find one the toy realm. He will be so excited to have one.
1,New Formula Doesn't Work as Well,"The old Grant's Ant formula containing arsenic worked very well. The new formula contains 1% Hydromethylnon, which I think that the ants are able to sense. Using the old product with arsenic the ants kept eating and taking back to the nest until the whole colony died. When I used the new formula the ants ate for a few minutes then stopped feeding and then ignored the bait."
1,Left my hair horribly greasy,"I ended up wheelchair bound for two months and thought this would be the easiest way of washing my hair. It was terrible; no matter how much product I used, my hair never smelled or felt clean. I threw away both bottles. Find a different product."
1,Junk. Mine leaked. Both of them.,"The old models worked, but mine finally gave out. So I got a new one. The seal leaked and water got all over my (thankfully stone) floor and ruined the motor. I thought it was a fluke so got another one. Same thing happened. This is the model that has been out for a couple of years that I am talking about - after they changed the water fill and release from the same plunger site to separate fill and release sites. Looking for something else now."
1,Disservice to Asian American History,"I will not even make a stab at trying to point out the numerous flaws and inconsistencies with this work. It is both facile and inaccurate, essentializing the experiences of Asian Americans in an Orientalist context. You are far better served reading any number of historical works that synthesize the experiences of Asian Americans, including Suchen Chan, Asian Americans: An Interpretive History (Boston: Twayne Publishing, 1991); Gary Okihiro, Margins and Mainstreams (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1995); and Ron Takaki, Strangers from a Different Shore, Revised Edition (New York: Penguin, 1998). As a historian of the Asian American experience, I am dismayed when I see anything trying to pass itself off as the end-all be-all. Asian American history is an exciting field with a number of excellent works by cutting-edge scholars. Do not waste your time on this book."
2,Loved It,"I loved the story about Casey and Mckinnon. I loved their chemistry. Both come from a place of pain and betrayal (yes I know, what romance book doens't) but I just liked how they were together. For me it had a bit of a sexy feel to it especially the late visits in the courtyard. Mckinnon was funny when he called her out on her kissing. LOL! A good book to enjoy."
1,Lame Vampire Movie,"What I kept thinking as I was watching Blade Trinity was: ""Oh, wait... they want us to take this seriously."" The plot, such as it was, was completely overshadowed by loud music and neato whiz-bang special effects.If you want to see Jessica Biel (as, no joke, Whistler's Daughter) looking fierce in tight clothes, maybe this is the movie for you. If you are a fan of the incredible Ryan Reynolds, he is his usual funny self, but has woefully too little screen time. As for the rest of the cast; Wesley Snipes rarely utters a word, Parker Posey does her usual scheming bitch, and Kris Kristofferson returns again. (Wait a minute - Didn't he die in movies number one AND two?) Not bad enough to walk out of, but not good enough to ever see again."
1,BAD Windows 98 Compatibility ... baaaAAAAAHHHHD Tech Supp.,"The utility installer is not compatible with Win98 installer engine. So, while the product might work in their lab. under Win98, the installer doesn't let you get there to find out. The software just won't install. And, since the drivers are not resident on the CD you can't even install it manually. This is why they tell you not to plug the card into the PCI slot first. I guess the drivers are buried somewhere in the code of the utility installer. The file that you download from their website (a supposed ""upgrade"") is actually the same version on the CD.Tech support is farmed out to a foreign country. These guys spoke english worse than any help desk I've run across. So, don't count on ANY T.S."
2,Why can't we pick 9 stars.,"If you are a ""true"" fan of Pink Floyd, be prepared for the ""gooseflesh"" on your skin as it tingles. Dial-down the band politics-ENJOY!"
2,Worthwhile reading,"I've read this book twice; good information for anyone with a tendency to ""overhelp"" another. Well written; definitely recommend."
2,Great Album,"This is truly an amazing collection. I've got a couple other Big Bill albums and I had the revelation the other day that Eagle Riding Papa is just about the same thing as the Bob Wills Light Crust Doughboys theme. There's excellent flat picking here, Mississippi River Blues is great. You aren't wasting your money here."
1,Boring to 6 month old,"Our 6 month old was not interested in this AT ALL. He was much more impressed with a rubber duck than this toy. Maybe when he's older, he might get more enjoyment out of it, but in the meantime, it's sitting in a basket. Now he LOVES theMunchkin Star Fountain(in blue)."
1,"Rating for sound quality, not the album itself","This is a great album.However, I had the same problem as another reviewer. The disc I received had very poor sound quality-- you could only hear music from one side of the headphones or from one speaker no matter what listening device was used."
2,Gems from Emerson,"I recently took a class that reawakened my love of Emerson. I checked out this book at the library, then had to own it. Each day of the year is a selected writing from Emerson's essays, sermons and or lectures. It's a great opportunity to read a gem from Emerson each day. Then there is a question that invites writing one's own essay or thoughts. I love this book!"
2,Sci-Fi lost in time,"Having purchased this set a month ago, I am still watching these films. A few I have seen before and were glad to add to my collection,some I didn't realize I'd seen before until I watched them, and some were surprises. None of the films I've watched so far are horrible. A few are campy,but that is the fun part of watching them.You can't go in expecting Spielberg because you will be disappointed. Over all,you get films that have been lost in time from the early 70s on into the 80s, and that is fun for me.Anyone who really is a sci-fi fan can see the creativity and imagination that went into these. Besides where else would you get this many hours of fun for this price?! Enjoy these as lost treasures."
2,spotted frog.,"Am very pleased with your Webkinz's, and my granddaughters love them. These were Birthday gifts, that I could not find any place else."
1,Unafraid: Mary...I'm afraid could not be finished.,"Ms. Rivers portrays Mary the Mother of Jesus as an often angry, pushy and even prideful woman. She obviously has issues with Mary, Jesus' Mother. While I have another of Ms. River's books that was given to me, I do not have much interest in reading it as I feel her credibility has been compromised with the writing of this book. In addition to demeaning Mary, there are many inaccurate presentations throughout the book."
1,BUYER BEWARE OF ANTONLINE,"Do not buy your camera carrying case through ANTonline if you want to be able to sleep at night. ANTonline has NO reputable customer service whatsoever! No telephone number, only an e-mail where they respond with platitudes that ""they will open an investigation."" Meanwhile, I still have not received my purchase and have not been refunded. They are more concerned with policing and smearing their customers in the review section, than they are with actually responding to REAL complaints. Think twice!!!"
2,Great Filter,This is the third one I bought for my third lens....its great and I am very happy with it. Doesnt impact the picture at all. Good filter for the SLR users!
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"THE worst! Washington and Hawke exchange badly scripted rants in performances no better than those found in really wretched community theatre. Fuqua's uninspired directing turns this movie into a typical made-for-ghetto blaster. The corrupt-cop genre has been done better MANY times before. As for Oscar, God in not great, D. In this case, God is overly generous."
1,Questionable about being new,"Not a new set and definitely not the ""original"" set of books.Pages are in good condition, but 2 of the books cover w/ ""some type of food"". Looks like some kid handle it after eating their snack.Also one of the book was replaced w/ another title."
2,Downton Abbey Season 1 (HD),Downton Abbey Season 1 (HD) Excellent series. Enjoyed the story line very much. Very entertaining. Would recommend this show to anyone..
2,"Good Product, But there is a TIRE issue","This was a nice (and less expensive) alternative for our 6 yr. old w/special needs-to be able to get on & off of without falling (he's physically uncoordinated)-low to the ground and he can pedal pretty easily. It was significantly less than the special needs tricycles we priced, and his normal functioning 4 year old brother has a blast on it-making freakishly fast turns on wood floors inside(Ha!) It is pretty wide, though, so we insist he slows down around corners-lots of scrapes on our cabinetry as he circles the kitchen island, etc.! (The back tire spokes scrape things.)BUT the one thing I'd agree w/others on is that the back tire went flat about a week or so after we got it at Xmas, so we called the company purchased from & they sent us 2 replacement tubes (custom type size) within 5 days or so at no charge. They were apologetic & said these were from a diff. manufacturer & should be fine. So far so good!"
2,The Lightning Incident,"This movie was great, it was about a woman who's baby was stolen by and her great depths to try and save her baby before it's too late. Starring Nancy McKeon, who plays an excellent role. I absolutely loved this film."
1,HOW DARE YOU WACHOWSKI BROTHERS! WHAT IS THIS!?,"WHAT ON EARTH WERE THEY THINKING!?! THE MATRIX WAS PRETTY GOOD! AND THEN THE MATRIX RELOADED WAS BETTER THAN THAT! AND THEN CAME THIS WORTHLESS LITTLE SPECK! THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN ANY TRILOGY! THE BEST THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT WASN'T AS LONG AS THE OTHERS! IT'S FLASHY, BUT BORING! THE SCRIPT IS PRETTY BAD, AND THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO PLOT. AND WHEN AGENT SMITH GOES (...) AT THE END, THERE'S NO EMOTIONAL IMPACT. THIS IS REALLY NOT WORTH SEEING, SO I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING IMPORTANT. TRINITY GETS IMPALED. THE HUMANS AND THE MACHINES MAKE A TRUCE. A FEW PEOPLE NAMELESS FACELESS PEOPLE GET RIPPED TO SHREDS. NEO KILLS SMITH. NEO DIES TOO. SOME LITTLE GIRL CREATES A SUN IN THE MATRIX. THE END."
1,What a joke,"Ok, first off, I am a huge Fleetwood Mac fan. If these cd's were called ""The best of the new Fleetwood Mac"", then fine. But let's look at just some of the great Green/ Welch songs that are left off this collection:Black Magic Woman, Rattlesnake Shake, Green Manalishi, Man of the World, Albatross, Need Your Love So Bad, Sandy Mary, Hypnotyzed, Sentimental Lady, Angel, Why, Jumping at Shadows, Oh Well, Heroes Are Hard to Find...At least some of these songs should have been put on the album, or else it's just a bogus best-of Fleetwood Mac. Don't get me wrong though, I love the newer lineup too, and I'm sure that these cd's are good :-) But it's just not really the best of Fleetwood Mac."
2,Thank you for excellent customer service and product,"Your fast turnaround in getting it to the destination made all the difference as the song, ""I Will Always Love You"" was played at my Grandfather's funeral dedicated to him from myself - who lives 3,000 miles away - and my Cousin - who lives 10 minutes away and was able to be certain that the song was played last at the end of his services as we had a very special bond with our Grandfather. Thank you so much for making that possible by shipping it so fast."
2,get it,"This movie was put together by the same people who did Saving Private Ryan, mostly. If you liked that movie, this one is up your alley."
1,NOT the soundtrack! BEWARE,"This is NOT the soundtrack to Ong Bak. If you look closely at bottom of the cover image it says something in French that I imagine means ""Songs Inspired by the music of Ong Bak."" This is a bunch of Rap with backing music similar to the music in Ong Bak. Very very disappointing for someone who hates Rap and wanted the soundtrack to Ong Bak!"
2,AWESOME- PERFECT- AMAZING - COOL!,"Friedman and Stecyk went all the way on this one. After seeing it at a film festival I thought the movie was amazing, but this book just took it all the way over the top. For sure, the only two people who could have done it, did it! Now I know more than ever why all these guys are living legends. Stecyk's original stories from the 70's and all of those previously un-released Friedman images from the 70's (100+ pages of them) are even more than I expected. The whole thing is nothing less than cool, inspirational and beautiful. This small format but thick book is amazing, it really does feel like a textbook on Dogtown that everyone who loves the movie or culture will have to own. I can't believe Friedman was so young when he shot those pictures! Stecyk's words will inspire, excite, and really entertain anyone who reads them, he's an awesome writer."
2,"Great Desk, I've been using it for about 6 years","This is a great desk. I've had mine for about 6 years. It is very roomy, has space for all my junk. In fact, maybe too much space because I never keep it clean. I don't understand why it is so expensive on here though. I got mine at walmart for fifty bucks. It was great deal!"
2,"Practical, and clearly written","Although I have used this text as a reference (vs. reading it all the way through, or for a class) I have found myself returning to it often. In fact, I purchased it only because I had started to wear out the copy I had borrowed from a friend...and she was missing it because she used it frequently, too. The best aspect of this text is the way the authors use examples relevant to clinical research for nearly every statistical decision. No more extrapolating from educational research, medical research...I don't usually have that much imagination! Good book."
1,Amazon Sent me a dented item (someone elses return?).,"In all these years, I never got such junk from Amazon. It was not damaged in shipping to me. The inner box was all torn up. The pot was dented. No damage to outer box. I'll never order cookware from Amazon again. Do brick and mortar store would have put such junk on their shelf. To Amazon's credit, they did replace it. So, I finally got my pot after 3 weeks of hassle. I'll go to the local kitchen store next time."
2,A diet plan that will change your life,"I've read it - I'm trying it. I've been following this plan for 12 days and I have lost 13.5 lbs. Better yet, I don't crave the carbs. Or for that matter, I don't crave to eat anything between meals! I recommend this book to everyone"
2,THIS IS A JOURNEY LOVERS DREAM!,"If you are a Journey fan-atic like myself, than this is for you! All the top recordings on 2 CD's. Their ballads ""Eyes of a Woman"" and ""Faithfully"" still bring back great memories. Yet they can still rock with ""Wheel In The Sky"". It's nice to be able to pop in a Cd with all their hits right at your finger tips. A must have for the true Journey Fan!"
1,Nortons internet security 2006/bad buy,"purchased a new computer. installed nortons internet security 2006 on it and my beautiful, fast, accurate system is now as bad as an early 386!! i can't even uninstall it (Is there a way?) tech support sent me to a website that offered to sell me additional norton's products and no help. i can't even uninstall w/ add remove/ or wipe programs. it hangs up my system whenever i try to access it or other programs as well, forget about being able to see my email! right click on the systems tray icon and the computer freezes. my new system is a mess!!!!! i do not trust norton's any more. i gave it a 1 star because there was no zero choice."
2,You'll never want another tooth brush again!,I have LOVED this toothbrush. I even bought the kids their own. No messy tooth paste in the sink and on the counter. This product was highly recommended by my dentist. Once you try it you won't be satisfied with the own fashioned toothbrush
2,I really loved it,"I love watching Jeff Dunham doing his act especiallly with Walter, Achmed, Bubba J, Peanut and Jose. I think their really funny."
1,Don't Bother,"I bought this album because of ""Don't Bother."" Yes, it is the best song on the album. The rest of the songs are hardly exciting. Her lyrics are excellent, but musically, nothing really stands out. In other words, if you are wondering if you should buy this album, take a hint from the first release from this album- Don't bother."
2,Great Book,A worthy finish to the series - makes you sad there won't be more Oakes books. The real events following the completion of the book (late 1993) don't really alter how Buckley painted 1994 and 1995. A great read.
1,Wait for the service patches to come out.,"As with all MSFT software the program has a clean ui, and it is pretty easy to figure out how to do stuff.However, this is the first release of a new version, and the resulting teething problems mean you should pause before purchasing this if you already have a C++ compiler.My primary complaints about the software are:- Libraries and software that compiled in MSVC++ 6.0 no longer compile in .NET. Worse, the errors listed by the compiler do not provide meaningful clues as to what is wrong(error C1001, internal compiler error). In the newsgroups, the standard MSFT response has been that the problem is with your source, not the compiler.- The help and the ui are not in synch. For instance, the names used in the help files for project properties, and the actual naming in the dialog are different. This makes it hard to determine what you need to change when trying to configure your project.Summary: Stay away unless you like living on the bleeding edge."
2,Paton's best!,"Probably one of the best books I've ever read. Well-paced, beautifully written and sad as all heck. Lots of good Afrikaans; I can imagine that aspect might be a struggle for some. I believe this book to be superior to 'Cry the Beloved Country', which is saying a lot."
1,Never saw something like that...!!,"NICKELBACK made something very unique, seldom I've witnessed something like that in the rock genre:The CD starts pretty well with two very good tunes: Never Again and How You Remind Me.Then, suddenly, there is simply no more CD!! It's as if there was no more songs on the whole CD, so bad and unmemorable they are! Just a mess! You can not believe it's the same band that recorded the first two tracks!! What a novelty act this band is!!!"
1,Sophomoric,"Some funny bits. Largely junior high humor. Maybe if one was drunk ... (As it happens, the copy I got is also unpleasant to read since it's a musty, old used version.)"
2,THIS IS THE BASS,"This is a must have if your old school I had this on tape before cd's and it was kicking than had to replace bcause someone stole it. I'm thumping again,lol"
2,Detailed & Great Translation,"This interpretation and translation of Holly Koran, is the best that I have seen in English, Unless if you are planning to buy a whole lot of sources, then this translation and its commentary holds very credible and authenticated scholarly work.If you could get a copy, please do and educate yourself by reading the commentary."
1,Didn't Work,"This product was advertised as working on XP but we could never get it to run. Needless to say my 6 year old was quite disappointed. Me too, cuz it looks fun."
2,My husband's favorite,"Again, we discovered this coffee as well while in Costa Rica on business last year. Deeper, more robust flavor, no bitterness. Also enjoyed the Tres Rios and volcano-area varieties."
2,Funnier than you think!!,"I am a huge Jimmy Fallon fan. So when I saw this one in the shops I bought it (I guess it's one of those things where you feel you have to prove to yourself you're a real fan)I was expecting a couple of his songs and then that was it.But actually, his songs are great to listen to. There are about 5 songs. After that, Jimmy does improv acting and impressions to a live college croud. It is hillarious. Even if you are not a Jimmy fan, it is worth getting.He closes the CD with ""Hammer time"" where Jimmy has found you can sing pretty much any 80's song to ""Hammertime"" and goes right ahead to show it.So funny!!!"
2,Mityvac 7201 Success Story,"I'm very pleased not to have to crawl under my car anymore and pull the drain plug to empty the oil.The Mityvac works as advertised. Very refreshing in today's market place of ""have to have"" items.All you do is push the small extraction hose down the oil dipstick tube and pump the siphon handle about ten times and watch the old used oil come out of your engine. Then pull your oil filter and replace it with an new one, and pour the new oil in. Fast and easy. No muss no fuss. It's the easiest and cleanest oil change I've ever done. I showed it to a friend and he rushed to Amazon to buy his own. I highly recommend it.tim...."
1,Live Mouse Trap,"I would never buy this trap again! I thought I would be doing the humane thing and not kill one of God's creatures, but the darn thing doesn't catch even a stink bug! Waste of Money!!!!"
2,Must read,"I was disappointed in this book in the beginning, because I was interested in learning more of the mother and what happened, but as I got into it, I was glad I continued reading it. Following Astrid through her unbelievable childhood was riveting - made me pass this book onto my teenaged daughter. I'm glad I didn't put it down too early."
2,This book changed my life,"Haven't written reviews here before, but seeing with delight that this book is still around I had to write one. I read this book midway through my junior year of high-school and, struck by the sensible and sound reasoning that informs every argument, I applied to a completely different set of schools than I initially considered. Ultimately I feel I profited invaluably from attending a small liberal-arts college instead of a big brand name: I was going through a lot of troubles, and the individual attention and support I was able to obtain from small departments, small classes, and concerned and caring professors (even outside of my major) allowed me to find my inner strengths and embark on a life path I would not have dreamed of when I first arrived at college. Now how many of my friends who went to big-name research universities can say that? Thanks, Mr. Pope."
1,The beginning of the end...,"I suppose it would have been far too much to ask for Weber to have kept up the quality he showed in the first two books. This book lacked both the hard sf aspect of the previous books and the sequels' drama; it bored me. The first two books, of course, are far better than anything else in the series - the following books descend into very readable formula novels. Good fun reading, but in no way comparable to On Basilisk Station."
2,Beautiful Ring,Very beautiful ring for the price...it looks like a ring that cost a lot more! it is prettier than the photos and not to big for small hands.
1,Useful for SAHM,"This is useful a book for stay at home moms or those who can nurse their baby on demand. But it is quite difficult to follow, if not impossible, for working moms. I was hoping that there will be a section for mothers like me who needs an alternative aside from doing the actual nursing but sad to say, it did not provide that."
2,Excellent Book,"I read the stories in high school and recently ran across the book in a box. I fell in love with it all over again. Very well written, suspenseful, and entertaining."
1,nut driver,"I bought these because i had a set of craftman drivers ,with the colored handles. These are not as good as those. I would have gotten the Craftsman or klein set but i dont like the smaller handles, on the smaller drivers and no color on the handle. The Stanleys are not marked on the ends either."
2,great CD and the deluxe extras are worth it!,The extra live performances (audio + video) are high quality and worth the extra cost over the non-deluxe CD. My only complaint is the video aren't higher resolution. There is also an interview video included.
1,Nearly put me to sleep!,"I bought 4 DVDs in this series, because I had heard the name ""Stott"" often in relation to Pilates. I was looking forward to solid instruction and moderately challenging exercises. To say I was sorely disappointed would be an understatement. I have had a difficult time getting through these workouts even once each, not because they are difficult, but because they are so incredibly slow paced and boring. Stott talks in a monotone throughout, and it took great effort to stay focused on the workout. Very, very boring! I would definitely not recommend these workouts unless you like following an instructor who is just barely above comatose energy."
1,boo,"The Eagles are the most boring cliched band. There is much much better American music out there, such as The Beach Boys and Creedence Clearwater Revival. I couldn't believe that this was ranked the best selling album of all time. It's sickening."
2,Great Pictures,"This is a great little 2 megapixel camera..... I was shocked when I got my film back (I ordered online) and the pictures really looked good. The software included with this camera is sooo easy and emailing the pictures could not be more self explanatory. I would highly reccomend this camera, especially if you just want to take casual pictures (pics for fun, etc.). I also have the Canon Powershot G2 and highly recomend it for higher quality (EXCELLENT) pictures. Overall, this is a great beginner camera and it's a lot of fun!"
1,Not so good,"I bought this film for my daughter and she bored, is good for a night without plans, but rent it."
1,Small,"This product was not worth the price I paid for. The product is too small. If you want to use the product to jot down only a phone number, than this product is a great gift."
1,Crow Lake,I was going to recommend this book to my book club and I am glad that I did not. I did not find this book to grab my attention.
2,John Powers classic,"After re-reading ""The Last catholic in America"" recently I discovered he had written a 3rd book in the series and promptly ordered ""the Unoriginal Sinner and the Ice Cream God."" I grew up in the same Chicago south side neighborhood as John (he went to grade school with my oldest brother and I went to High school with his sister.) Being able to relate on that level made my enjoyment of this book even more special but his witty humor and interesting characters would make this book great reading no matter where you grew up. I recommend reading all his books and highly recommend this one. john Powers does not disappoint!"
1,Why is this book getting so much praise?,"I totally agree with the Reader from Newton, MA in her scathing review of August 11, 2000. (Please read it! She says everything I was going to say.) The satire might be biting, but the characters are unlikely as well as unlikeable, the plot thin and unbelievable. The girl Angela is so repulsive it's impossible to believe even a professor as stupid as that one would fall for her, especially since he was ""happily married."" All in all, this book is another one of those too-many-being-published-all-the-time TREE WASTERS. Makes one wonder why this author is so ""acclaimed."""
1,Not a book many women would enjoy....,"I had high hopes for this book, but the more I read it the less I liked it. The characters were just dopey, and not very likeable. The male protagonist was self-absorbed and shallow that he treated the women in his life in a shoddy way. I just couldn't get attached to anyone in the book, or care about what happened. I would't recommend it."
1,"Poorly written, confusing for students","I thought this was going to be as good as C How to Program, however this book was a big disappointment for me. Too many simple and useless examples, hard to get the point."
2,I Shot Andy Warhol,"This is an excellent flick with great performances by Lili Taylor and Stephen Dorff. Fans of indie-rock will enjoy seeing Yo La Tengo performing as The Velvet Underground at Warhol's Facory, which was perfectly depicted in this film."
1,"pen works well, cap is loose and falls off","If the cap on this pen worked better it would be a 4-5 star device. I like the way it works -- you do have to squeeze it a little but the flow of cover-up is easy to control.Unfortunately the cap is always falling off, including in my pocket. I have tossed out several because the cap got lost."
2,Best version of the Firebird Ballet I've heard!,"Finally, the 1972 version of the complete Firebird Ballet directed by Ozawa is out on CD. This is the best version of the ballet I've ever heard. Instead of short sticcattos, the last notes of the finale are more melodic. It's a wonderful version, and anyone who loves the Firebird as much as I do should enjoy the sooting, very melodic direction of this greatest work of Stravinsky."
2,My 2- and 5-year old love it!,"This movie gives me much peace and quiet in our rowdy household! My two-year old boy and five-year old girl both sit still through this one, in its entirety. My two-year old was sick for two days, and he watched it six times during those two days. He sat still, by himself (sister was at school), and watched it, riveted. I checked on him while I puttered around straightening things, and he never moved, until the ending credits. Then, he was up like he was shot out of a gun, dancing around, saying ""Monster, monster"". As is usual with Disney/Pixar, it operates on more than one level. Observant parents will catch some very funny moments (we can all relate to the work-a-day grind). The sushi bar is probably my favorite. Anyway, anything that can quiet my two for longer than five minutes is more than OK in my book!"
2,Brilliant,This is one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. It didn't take me long time to finish it and I'm already reading the second book of the Farseer trilogy.I think Robin Hobb built an incredible story coupled with excellent characters. Well worth reading it!
1,Don't Blame Tiffany Shepis...,"Alright, this entire movie is indeed a disaster. The ""kid"" Lester, is awful, as is the rest of the cast. That is, except for Tiffany Shepis. She is not only beautiful, but quite good and believable in her role as Lester's only hope of ever having a friend. Unfortunately, the rest of this movie is tedious and dull to the extreme! You'd think that a vengeful, acrobatic, wise-cracking scarecrow would at least be good for some laughs. Alas, he's just as bad as the rest of this torturous pile of dog brownies! Oh well, don't say I didn't warn you..."
2,Fantastic Bag,"The quality of the bag is fantastic! I'm using the bag to fit 6 LED par 38 uplighting cans with their tripod feet. Yes that's right, there's so much space in the bag, it fits the feet attached to the light! I have only had it for little time, so I'm not sure how durable it is yet, but it really feels like great quality."
1,Speculative Fiction?,"A friend urged me to read this book knowing that I had some interest in Arthurian lore and in feminist theory. The author has me puzzled on both accounts. It's not just that she posits some unusual ideas, it's the flat statements of fact she makes. I know of nothing that backs up some of her conclusions-- and the author does not support these statements with any citations. The first one that really brought me up short was something like, Guinevere's marriage contract with Arthur made her his archivist. That is not a direct quote but it's close enough. Marriage contract? Where did this document come from? And why would she be made her husband's archivist?So, if you are looking for ideas for speculative fiction about Guinevere this is the place to look. If you are looking for facts about Dark Age Britain then look elsewhere."
2,Spiritual Rock,"This CD has it all. It's a little bit country, and a little bit rock, with a backup band that has the big band sound. Great for anyone looking for a clear gospel sound with a universal message."
2,Excellent!,I read it in no time! It's extremely entertaining...just keep in mind he is a Latin American writer more specifically Colombian and I the reviewer am Colombian as well!
2,"A Grand Gripping Tale of ""Uplift,"" Treachery, and Heroism","Readable -- perhaps compulsively so -- tale of a far future when all-too-human motives appear in ""uplifted"" dolphins and apes (who, with suitable vast volumes of water for the dolphins and their ilk, serve with human beings aboard starships). A slam-bang ending. Concepts to ponder (but when did SciFi lack CONCEPTS?) and characters -- especially the ""uplifted"" species -- rendered with a rare degree of density and fascination. Brin's best. Does NOT need the rest of the Uplift Trilogy (and may fare better in the reader's memory WITHOUT it)"
2,Amazing!,I love both of the songs on this single. If you enjoyed the first cd you will love this one too. I can't wait for the second album to come out!
1,Bland.,"The kind of repetetive, banal, Tolkien-referrenced nonsense that gives fantasy a bad name. Loved by pre-teens, juveniles, and neophytes to the genre. Not a bad introduction to fantasy if you are young, but definitely uninteresting to an adult reader."
2,The best WWF event in years!,"Rock vs Austin need i say more. This was the best wrestlemania ever,and that's the bottom line cause i said so."
1,The butchering of a masterpiece,"The reason that this film lacks cohesion between the animation and live action, is that the creator did not create any of the animated segments. All of this film's animated sequences are taken directly from Mamoru Oshii's brilliant yet obscure film, Tenshi no Tamago (Angel's Egg), and justice is certainly not done to it. Many people (including myself) consider the original film to be Oshii's best work, and it is without a doubt, a masterpiece. This film degrades it by cutting parts of it together with footage (live action) of a much lower standard.I advise anyone who finds this film interesting to track down ""Tenshi no Tamago"". It is generally hard to find, but if you can get a hold of a copy (preferably an original widescreen DVD) it's well worth it - Tenshi no Tamago is certainly a film worthy of a five star rating."
2,great one!,"Having just readPersonal Best - How Ordinary People Achieve Extraordinary Success and How You Can Too,I was keen to read this book to keep the momentum going . I have read many books on personal finance and wealth building, but this one by Brian Tracy is really good. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Read the book, constantly refer to it, or listen to the Cd's. This is truly a resource to be used ov. I highly recommend this book."
2,written review,I received 2 kindles both which were faultyHaving finally received the 3rd one I am happy to report its a very good productI would also like to compliment the service I got from Amazon in replacing the faulty KindlesI can only imagine that they had received a faulty batch
1,not review request,Please include titles of songs this would assit me in deciding to purchase cd. Thank you!
2,Every Little Girl's Dream House,"This Barbie House was everything I thought it would be and more. My 5-year old daughter is in love with it, and has not stopped playing with it since Christmas. Lots of cute ""bells and whistles"" - appliances make sounds, doorbell, music, etc. I didn't think it was too difficult to put together - maybe took a little over an hour. Worth every penny!"
2,Great music memories,Great music. Converted my old obsolete vinyl Albums to CD with this purchase and then downloaded into my MP3 player. Listen to all the oldies driving to and from work. It brings me back to College days listening to the tunes I grew up on.
1,Not worthy of Wilton's name,This device is terrible! The teeth don't stay in the holder and keep falling out before you can even try it out on the cake! Don't waste your money!
2,Light-hearted study in contrasts,"An attentive little girl compares Thanksgiving at her own home and that of Abigail Archer, whose family ""is perfect in every way"":""Their turkey is plump and golden.Their napkins are made of lace.Their table is lit with candles.They all hold hands for grace.""In her house, the smoke alarm wails, sister slurps and uncle burps. Instead of homemade pie with fancy whipped-cream swirls, they have a Jell-O mold that wiggles off its plate and onto the floor.Lighthearted paper-collage illustrations contrast the serenity of one family with the pandemonium of the other. Despite their differences, however, both families are alike in their love for one another."
1,Poor Blues Reference Book,"If a guy whose passion was really rock and roll were to write a book on essential blues, this would be it. All the recommendations are safe rock 'n' roller type picks which aren't bad just inconsistant and incomplete due to unfamiliarity with the genre. The real crime is that essential people are left out like Robert Nighthawk. Buy the AMG Blues Guide instead and make your own top 100."
2,Awesome For One Room,"I should look closer at these things before I buy. This is an awesome reciever and you cannot beat the price. The sound quality is fantastic and I love the built in XM Radio. My only problem now is that I want to listen to XM throughout my house and this is at most a two room reciever. It has a second hookup for two additional speakers, but I should have looked closer and bought a multisource hookup so I could have attached my Audio Receiever that could do the whole house. I should have bought the next model up. Other than that this is an awesome reciever. The optical hookups make a big difference in sound quality. I don't run video through this, only audio and it's great! Buy it if you want excellent home theatre or audio in a single location."
1,Won't work with ipod classic,Won't work with the latest newest Ipod classic. This is a convenient gadget and transferred hundreds of pictures on vacation for me with my original ipod. Then the ipod was stolen and the latest greatest ipod won't work with the camera connector now all I get is hardware not supported.A good gadget rendered useless. I'm desperate for it to work again!
2,A Solid Book for Intermediate/Advanced ESL students,"This solid book provides ESL students and community college members with a strong foundation in academic writing.Grounded in both classic techniques and modern readings, Blueprints 2 helps fill that awkward, and considerable, skills gap between what weak students know and what college courses require. An excellent resource for IEP summer programs - and low level community college composition courses.Although I currently teach another text, Introduction to Academic Writing for Graduate Students (Swales), I also know that many of my so-called ""Intermediate ESL"" graduate students would benefit a great deal from this fine text.By the way, the author Folse has made many contributions to the ESL field from his excellent Great Essays and Great Paragraphs to Clear Grammar 2 and Discussion Starters."
2,Best Cat food EVER!!!,"This stuff is great. The cats love it ( all flavors actually), and since eating it their coats are softer, shinier, with less dandruff."
2,I love this album,"I've never reviewed music before, feeling it's too subjective and personal to really rate. But I rediscovered this album recently, and thought people should now how marvelous it is. If you like Johnny Clegg, I think you'll enjoy this album as well. Not the same, but cut from the same cloth in terms of danceability and social conscience."
1,TaxCut is very user unfriendly,I had lots of problems with this software. The most user unfriendly software I have ever used. There were lots of forms that were not updated and need to be downloaded from the web. I would not buy this software again.
2,An education in itself...,"Being a college student, I was at first reluctant to read Seybold's book as a class assignment. In hindsight, it's one of the best decisions I could've made. This book presents dynamic ideas that are being overlooked at universities today. Rather than focusing on the ""how to's"" Customers.com gives you the ""why's"" of the customer market. Talk about making me think! Not only did this book provide an excellent point of reference for class discussions, I found myself unconsciously transferring the knowledge into my job. One thing to take note of: THIS IS MORE THAN A TECHIES BOOK! Anyone in business will undoubtedly benefit from reading it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
2,Great Horror,"This book has many classics like ""The Loved Dead"" and ""The Parasitic Hand."" It has something for every horror fan."
1,Great but bad,"I would give this game a perfect 5 but I'm amazed at how dark the screen is! When I first turned it on I could barely see anything. I had to sit next to a bright light and awkwardly hold it up. This is a MAJOR flaw. No matter how good the game is it will never live up to it's full potential thank to the GBA's poor lighting. That aside, the GBA's graphics are amazing after playing the old Game Boy. The Super Nintendo graphics are still welcome in the hands of gamers and the audio is surprising good. The screen size should be bigger but with color and great graphics the picture is still easy to see. That is, if you've got a bright light to sit next to."
1,Worst Slipknot CD Ever,"Ok I normally like Slipknot, but when I heard this new CD it made me hate them. This has to be their worst CD. Almost all of the songs on the CD sound almost exactly the same and plus they changed their style a bit and they changed it for the worse. I recommened buying their earlier CDs, not this one."
1,"Poor track selection, even worse production","This 2-CD set features very poor track selection, coupled with a completely pointless track ordering. The tracks are arranged in no chronological order and jump from album to album without any coherency at all. But what really makes this compilation unbearable to listen to is that someone had the sad idea to fiddle with the original mixes, so most of the tracks sound different to the originals - and worse, for that matter. Avoid this mistake of a release - even if you're new to Marianne Faithfull's material and are just willing to get a taste of her music - and buy the albums separately, specially the two masterpieces ""Broken English"" and ""Strange Weather"" together in the 1-CD MFSL edition, and also the more recent ""Vagabond Ways"" and ""Before The Poison""."
1,Politically Correct Nonsense,"This book is, quite bluntly, misguided touchy feely drivel.When I was a kid, I was terrorized by bullies, and it took me years to learn that a bully understands and reacts to only one thing, a fist in the nose. Once I started fighting back, they started leaving me alone. Reasoning with a bully about how their actions are inappropriate doesn't work. Never has, never will.Never start trouble, never seek it out, but when it comes to you, meet it head on, and it will be driven away. That's reality.And then, there is the even more subtle anti-spanking message hidden in the story. More drivel. The problem with bullies is not that they are spanked at home, but more than likely they are allowed to be horrid little brats who are never punished for anything wrong that they do.This book is not just a joke, it has no concept of the real world, and should be avoided."
1,Slaughter House Five,"I thought SHF was a very detailed book, and I thought it was a little intense and grose. I think he needed to slow it down a little bit."
1,Just another Self-Help book,"I know everyone loves this book, but I was so bored with it. I think this book is about as basic as they come and, call me superficial, but I think Byron Katie is ""Loving What's On The Cover"". I'm not bitter against the woman, but putting yourself on the cover of a book with this title is asking for a joke or two. Anyway, about the book, I owned it, and I'm giving it to charity. I've read more than my fair share of self-help books, and this one, it's just NOT the one."
2,The Real Star: Duke Ellington,"When I watch this movie, I must confess that I am being distracted by the music. The late, great musicologist Martin Williams one remarked that it's a bad score, as it takes away one's attention from the story. Fortunately, the music score is available in (almost) its entirety. Composed and arranged by Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, you can listen to it on Columbia/Legacy CK 65569, [....] I think the music will still be listened to in 50 years, when the story, the movie will be forgotten. But ... you can see the Duke in the movie, and listen to him while Jimmy Stewart 'plays' the piano ... That's why ""d give 4 stars to this DVD.Loek Hopstaken"
1,Commercial junk,"Do you want to know why this book is garbage? I'll tell you. Because it recycles ideas about faith that have been around since the time of the Bible. Get ""The Power of Positive Thinking"", (written in the 1940's by Norman Vincent Peale) and you will see all the same ideas which have been repackaged and branded (marketing is such a great invention, is it not?) by today's slick self-help ""gurus"". The difference is, you can get a copy for a buck in a used book store down the street, while this book is a rip-off. It is a rip-off in every sense of the word. The title is an outright lie - what's the big secret? Just about everything in this book is already known and has been published in 100's or even 1000's of books."
1,only one stocking,i guess the stocking is alright but BRWARE....there is only one stocking in the package...i thought it would come in pairs.....so that makes the price high also....
2,A very good read but strung out in the end,"This is a very good writer with lot of experiences either in the street, the Job, or the Army. The whole texture of the story is bit random, mixed with lot of songs, flashbacks, monologues either with the blind dog or Hanson himself, ...and the author seemed to lose focus in the middle and the story became more and more far-fatched confusing with lot of small unimportant sex, drugs incidents, although it still could hold my patience and curiosity to hang on finishing it. Dana so far is the most desirable partner that any street cop could dream of. He died in the later stage of this book, but Anderson simply missed the chance to make this book a real touching one, he made Hanson a totally heartless s.o.b., albeit Dana's widow was even worse. A messy but very interesting book."
1,Pass on this one,"I wish I had seen all of these mediocre reviews before I bought this (in my local store, sorry Amazon). I picked this up after reading that they were the openers on the last Brian Jonestown Massacre tour. But fans of those guys (or any modern psych or garage influenced music), be forewarned--this is a forgetable dud.These songs aren't timeless, they're just endless..."
1,"Great, if you like Blue screens","Complaints about ""unexpected kernal mode trap"" error are unresolved. Run both programs and watch the blue screens arrive. Check out their site for this error report from others. There solution is there is no solution and has not been one for about six months now. Also there support must have blue screen problems, they don't reply."
1,Neat stuff.,"Neat stuff came in the lp, Don't know about the cd. the lack of any songs and yoko doing her thing was pretty bad. If a fan buy it ,If not stay away."
2,I have to have her!,"This yasmin is probably the most cutest one ive ever seen!I love her beaded skirt and the tinsel.I think these dolls say ""Back off Barbie"".This girl is an absolute have to have for me!GET HER!"
2,Good and cheap,"I bought this item more than a month ago, it has no problems so far. and it's very handy, apart from being very cheap compared other items with different brands."
2,Love It!,"If you are a fan of The Mamas and the Papas, then this is definitely a must-have for your collection. Only complaint is some of the vocal tracks are muted too much on a few tracks."
1,BEWARE!!!,Beware of poor product description on this Toshiba DVD/VCR player. While it has Component and S-Video quality outputs.....they only work with the DVD Player! The VCR only has Composite outputs for it!!!! Who uses Composite outputs in this day! I requested a refund 10 minutes after I opened the box....which was so worn and torn that it was obvious others had done exactly the same thing!
2,Best Introductory Book on Database Programming in C#,"Take any programming books and one thing you must know before purchasing is what background the authors are assuming about you. Many database programming books already assume a level of proficiency with databases. However, with this book, the assumption is you know NOTHING about databases. (You do, however, need to have some basic C# skills).I like the teaching philosophy it uses - you will code a short ADO.NET program in chapter 4, the authors will then do a line-by-line exposition and then spend FOUR more chapters (chapters 5 to 8) into an in-depth but understandable explaination on the key concepts in chapter 4. So you get a big picture of what you're doing and then going deep to understand the micro-aspect of it.If you've been programming C# for awhile and intend to venture into the marvelous world of databases - this is THE book to begin."
1,Equating Science with Communism,"The very first scene in this movie shows you all you need to know: the Wall going up in East Germany by the communists. And Stein really wants me to believe that people who believe in evolution are like the communists ? It is not only non-sensical, but to me, very offensive. I have been in East Germany and I consider myself a Reagan conservative. This analogy between the Soviets - who murdered dissenters, and scientists, is cheap, ridiculous, and offensive."
1,reignite ethnic hatred,another one of those books with an obvious agenda behind before even the first ink was put down on paper. an aggressive but at times interesting literary style does at times got me going but for people aware of the subject is a piece they will be skimming through with the typical historically revisionist views. there factual historical and numerical errors wrto the historical time period. as long as you dont take it for real history the story line is about average for a historical fantasy.
2,OLD SCHOOL EXCELLENCE!!,THIS IS A TOP TEN OLD SCHOOL FLICK THAT DEFINANETLY NEEDS TO BOUGHT IF YOUR A COLLECTOR. IVE WATCHED THIS MORE TIMES THEN ANY OTHER FLICK THAT I HAVE. THIS AND MYSTERY OF CHESS BOXING..AND MAYBE THE VICTIM...
2,Too adorable for words!,"I saw these in person at a manufacturer's outlet store and as a berry fan, I simply HAD to have them. They are very cleverly designed - the lids fit snugly and don't wobble, thanks to a little notch in the cover and a matching one in the bottom piece. As you can see from the photo, the lids all have handles for easy unveiling of your culinary masterpiece inside.Amazon doesn't tell you how big these casseroles are, but I will: the package says the capacity of the strawberry, raspberry and blackberry casseroles is 14 oz. The blueberry, with its non-tapered bottom, holds nearly 50% more (20 oz.).Your friends and family might get suspicious if you always take the blueberry for yourself, but don't worry - I won't tell!"
2,Awesome,I loved this movie. it showed what a families go through to try to find freedom in the United States. I felt the movie was very realistic and honest.
2,Foam pad review,I've not used the item yet. It's purpose is to serve as an improvised bed for travel around the country. It should be adequate to the purpose (although I would have appreciated being able to find a thicker version).
1,Where's Abbott&Costello???,"I know I was just a little kid when I used to watch these guys, but what's up with all the ""singing & music"" I mean, Abbott & Costello crack me up, but you don't see much of them on this entire DVD if you ask me. It's as if ""THEY"" were the guest stars. If you love this sort of stuff, you'll love this DVD. I would recommend ""The Best Of Abbott & Costello Vol. 3"
1,"Nice as sculpture, horrible lamp.","The clearcoat finish over brushed aluminum makes this an attractive lamp. The fact that the lamp quit working on the day after I bought it makes it horrible. I picked one up at Lowes for $79.95. It worked about 5 or 6 times and then failed completely. It looks good on my desk, to bad I can only see it during the day when I don't need it.-- Chris"
1,Common Sense Book,I have read about half of the book and i dont even want to read the other half its just not interesting at all. The writer talks about basic information nothing special.
2,Size issues,"I'm finding these type of pajamas really run small, so be sure to order one size up. I bought these for my husband for his birthday as he always comments on how he used to have the pajamas with feet and a drop-seat. He was completely amused and excited to try them on, but sadly they were too short/tight. We returned them with no problem, but I was bummed-out my hubby didn't order another pair. Drag. Otherwise, the pjs were of great quality!"
1,Disappointing,"I hope this went straight to video because it was lousy. Bought and watched the first seven Tom Selleck Jesse Stone movies and enjoyed them and my husband and I were looking forward to this latest Tom Selleck venture, but were left underwhelmed. A brooding Jesse Stone was expected, but this latest movie, with its minimal dialogue and long pauses was a complete waste of time. We kept hoping it was going to get better, but it did not."
2,nail strengthener,"this product came recommended after i redeemed a groupon for a mani pedi and was complaining about my normally strong nails, which have become weak and splitting recently. i'm on week 3 of using this polish and so far so good."
1,Not very useful,"Doesn't have much info - it's a Rough Guide diluted 5:1.Huge empty page margins, big spacing between lines...Adds nothing to my Rough Guide..."
1,"Yes Are A Great Band, But This Is Not Them At Their Best.","Yesterdays brings together songs from Yes, their self titled debut and 2nd album Time And A Word, plus a 10 minute version of Paul Simon's America.To be honest their cover of America dose'nt seem to work and not enough tracks have stood the test of 40 odd years.The better songs are Time And A Word and particularly Survival, the harmonies are excellent, basically everything comes together.Yes fans who want all their recordings will want this one, but not everyone else."
1,Nothing About The Decision Making!,"Sheldon M. Stern speaks of only the what-ifs that surrounded the President before and after the actual event of President John F. Kennedy. From within 5 minutes of President Kennedy learning of the USSR missile-ship coming towards Cuba to after the US ships escorted the USSR missile-ship to open sea I was on one line with President Kennedy, with Nikita Khrushchev on another line and Fidel Castro on another line- the 4-line phone set-up had been installed in my home by the US State Department 5 years before. The US got it's money worth that time. Sheldon M. Stern made much money repeating speculation and gossip of those who pretended to know."
2,Pure Pop Perfection,This album has so much emotional heart to it.The song you send me flying is destined tobe a classico.Fromm 1-10 I give this 9.5
2,Wow!,"This is unlike anything I have ever read. It remains as shocking, in many ways, today as it did when originally released. This is a unique literary effort that also happens to be strongly illustrated."
2,ALLL TO GETHER GREATNESS,This Book is EYE opening I personally like alot of parents out there Look for Parenting books and READ ALOT ALOT ALOT of them.. I have so many when i buy one now i have to sell one.. but because i have too many..This book touches on teaches and shows everything you can think of when you think of Playful Parenting Its one of the first books i have bought on Amazon.com and i have started buying more..I know that you will INJOY THIS BOOK as i did and as you can see ALOT more Parents have also.
1,It didn't stop,"I didn't find the book very helpful. It used a lot of words to discover why the dog barks, but not much information on how to stop it...except to say...it's very difficult."
2,Above average Regency Romance,"This book tells the story of Erica Stone, who left Regency England to be with a husband she barely knew. She arrives in Vienna to find her husband mysteriously murdered and herself alone. Owen Kingsley, the Duke of Graves promises her protection if she will spy for England during the Congress of Vienna.I found the setting for the book very interesting, and as a whole I liked the book very much.I haven't given it a 5 star rating because although Erica's character was very well developed, the Duke's history was only hinted at and never fully developed. I kept having the feeling, that somewhere along the book I missed something. I wish the author had taken a few more pages of the book to tell us in some detail how the Duke came to do the job he was doing. On the whole it is a very good book, quite above the average for a Regency Romance."
1,Disjoint collection,"This book is awful. It doesn't discuss the issues of Configuration management, it isn't a how-to book. It is a collection of disjoint material and results that would appeal to no one, or at least I have no idea who the target audience is. I bought this online and would not have purchased it at all if I had flipped through the pages in a bookstore first."
1,Batteries not included...,My son will never get to play with this toy the way it was intended. After searching store after store I found a battery for 20 dollars the charger for the battery was 30. Not such a great deal now is it?
1,Not for the true horror fan,"This is a horror/thriller about a killer running amok during a movie marathon. The idea behind the movie is sort of cool and ahead of its time, being that is was released in theaters in 1989. I think that is the only real positive thing I can say about this film. As far as acting goes, the movie stars Jill Schoelen and Tom Villard as the main charecters, and the acting is terrible and unconvincing. Also, the movie is not scary at all, in fact they try to make it funny by adding jokes. This is definitly not for the hard core horror fan, but maybe fans of the Scream and Urban Legend type of horror movies might find something special in this movie. As for quality, it made a good transition to DVD, although a bit grainy in some scenes. The sound is also decent throughout most of the movie. One thing it could have used is more extras added to the DVD."
1,Elevator Music,"I'm really surprised at the number of great reviews appearing here for this CD. I am a huge Moody Blues fan, and I own all of their albums, and I had high hopes after the abysmal ""Keys of the Kingdom"" CD. I keep listening to Strange Times hoping I like it better with continued listening, but I don't. I can barely get through most of John Lodges elevator music, and there isn't really a standout song on the whole CD. I really think these great reviews are a result of lowered expectations. After ""Keys"" I agree that ""Strange Times"" is better...but not by much. Where is Mike Pinder when you need him?"
1,Another bad MTV productions,"This is supposed to be the ""REAL"" OC. Please. MTV has always been producing stupid ""reality"" shows that are supposed to be real, but this Laguna Beach is really really stupid. Plus, MTV always runs marathon on its show on the weekend, just watch it on TV. Don't waste your money."
1,Do not trust this company,"This product is great, I wear it everyday; However, when I purchased it from Amazon, it came to me from a perfume wholesaler. It was not the same scent that the bottle states it was, it was a fake. When I contacted the company, they told me to send the bottle back to them and they would do testing in their laboratory. They said they would send me a new bottle. Well, that never happened, and after getting the runaround several times, they refunded my money. That is the only reason why they received 1 star, because they did refund my money"
1,A Sad End,"What makes the Saw movies interesting aren't the traps or gore, but Tobin Bell's Jigsaw. The moral complexity. The questions of what a person will do to survive. It was a kind gross out vigilante horror film and it worked. Saw: The Final Chapter loses that little complexity that the franchise has, and lacks any coherent story. There are no clever tricks in the narrative, no real gotcha moment that were present in earlier entries of this series. It's simply gave in to being torture porn and that's all you get. Trap after trap that can't be beaten, each one grosser than its predecessor. The films were never genius film-making, but there was always a subversive sense of fun in Jigsaw's traps being a kind vigilante justice. With that gone, all that's left is the morbid effects. Effects don't make a movie, and as a movie, this is a lousy one. Even hardcore fans should be wary. There's nothing here worth watching."
1,The magnet is too week more like for one bill.,The design is cool and it looks great. Very neat but it does not hold many bills is place. Hold a bill or two perfectly if fold one time. If you carry 5 or bills its a waste of time. The magnet does not hold and your money might fall out if you don't hold it is place when you pull out your wallet
2,IT WORKS!,Our office has used this same scanner for at least 8 years. I was happy to find an identical scanner that we already had. We can not afford to update workstations so the Windows XP software was happy to have the replacement as well. Hopefully we'll recover in this sagging economy and eventually update everything!
2,Excellent Read,This book is a wonderful resource and guide for my teens. They have read it and love it. I highly recommend it to those of you with children entering or already in high school!
2,Nice,"The songs are catchy, especially the last half of the album, but the first half is week. Could have been much better, but i'll give it 4."
2,"Fascinating: ""Starseeds Explain It All For You""","If you are a seeker, and unsatisfied with religious ""faith,"" the Starseeds present an explanation of the universe that works - one that incorporates all human experience, including metaphysical & extraterrestrial, as well as simple human interaction. It is also fully consistent with, and I would say in fact complementary to, the Seth books. If you are not familiar with Seth, start with Seth Speaks, by Jane Roberts (who was the medium at that time for the entity named Seth). It is quite fascinating how Seth speaks from a localized cosmological perspective (localized meaning earth-bound), whereas the Starseeds, from ""elsewhere in the universe"", present the same cosmos from a much larger perspective."
2,"Great new music from Korn, but doesn't match old quality.","A few months ago, when I looked at korn.com's updates page and Jon said the new album would be a lot like their first self titled album, I got excited; mostly because the first album was my favorite. When issues came out, I listened to it.. and there are some great new tunes, but it doesn't have the quality or lyrics that the past few albums had."
1,Impossible to use ... hardly any pictures!,"I took a chance on this book and - wow - it's awful. I'm going to be returning it to Amazon.The ""flip chart"" design is a real pain! And - because of the weird design - a lot of the recipes have no picture.I'm still looking for the perfect ""cupcake"" book. This is not it!Save yourself the hassle of having to send it back and try to look at this one at a bookstore first!"
2,"Great Bargain, Great for Gamers","I love this DVD player! This is the best value, it comes with a case, every cable you will need, two sets of headphones, and a headphone splitter to make two headphone jacks! I am a gamer on the road, and so I used its A/V ports a lot! If you want to play games with it though, find a Female to Female A/V Adapter to connect your system to the player. I highly reccomend this to just about anyone who wants a solid DVD player for a good price!"
2,"Book is Good, Extra Goodies are Great!!","I took the A+ Cert tests over the past week. I got a 812 for Hardware and 780 for the OS Portion. This book was a very useful study guide. The best part of it for me what the CD Rom. I found it very helpful to go through the end of chapter questions, and then go back and see what I needed to study. It was helpful that I do have some experience in the field. The Practice Exam and the Bonus Exams were very Helpful."
1,Blu Ray Video Quality is Poor,"This is a review of the PQ of the newly released blu ray of the original True Grit.There is so much edge enhancement applied to the picture that it appears fake, more like overprocessed video than film. I found it very distracting through the entire movie, and would never choose to watch this blu ray again. Not unless it was remastered properly and reissued (not likely).Stay away from this blu ray release. At the very least, rent it before you buy it to avoid disappointment."
1,More Anti-Nazi Crap From Hollywood,"This movie is no Schindler's List. The characters were laughable (Henry Fonda states at one point that the Germans had better watch out because now He is angry; Robert Shaw is an SS man with a thick Irish accent). But the most laughable section were the tank battles: the real Battle of the Bulge took place in the Ardennes, a heavily forested, mountainous region in Belgium; the film was shot in the flat Arizona desert)."
2,Goodkind is tops!,"I have been reading fantasy since the fifth grade with Andre Norton's ""Outside."" I have enjoied authors such as Andre Norton, Tolkin and Stephen R. Donaldson. Since reading ""Wizard's First Rule"" and the following novels in Goodkind's Sword of Truth Series I have come to put him and his novels up there with some of the greats. Goodkind has an eye for detail, romance, friendship, honor and even bloody gore! In a strange sick way I love the combination of all of that. Not only is Richard an honorable hero, but so is the brave and intelligent Kahlen. I love it when the women kick butt too! The only reason I dislike picking up a Goodkind novel is because at some point it will have to end. These stories excite and fancinate me. Keep them coming Terry!"
2,Surprisingly good,"Although this seems like just another typical (or stereotypical) desi/NRI film, the high rating is the first indication that something else has been produced. The plot is pretty straightforward and simple and that there is a party and the film explores a number of the naive characters who attend, host or are attempting to attend that very party. The acting is solid, without involving the usual and repetitive actors, instead, a fresh new and talented team. The comedy was pretty good and overall, it was very entertaining. All in all, the producers have made a very safe and limited film as their attempt but have succeeded in making the overall impression very good. The babes are good too."
1,"Bad acting, waste of time.","This is one of the worst movie I ever watched. I rented the disc, and feel lucky that I never buy this movie.Jeff Bridges is so-so, Tim Robbins looks more like a serial rapist rather than terrorist. Joan Cussack in suspense movies? You've gotta be joking!One star is one too many. Trust me. Do NOT buy this movie. Save your money and time."
1,Sappy love story....blah,"My gf pretty much forced me to watch this flick with her and I resented every minute of it. If you're a guy, I would highly advise against watching this movie. Very sappy."
2,Marylin Monroe meets Dinah Washington,"I have to say how impressed I am with her vocals on this album, not to mention the rest of the band's awesome talents.I've seen her a few times live and it's amazing everytime, The mood of this CD is so moving and has such a smooth flowing style to it, I really noticed her Dinah Washington style influence in this album, But nothing beats her savory Bettie Page appearance, Not only is she a sweet person, but her heart is really into this album and it shows!Gotta love Lavay!-Seth-"
1,Terrible device,"Over the years I have had several wireless notebook cards. The Belkin N1 card is the worst I have ever had. With my laptop on my lap in the living room about 15 feet from my Belkin N1 wireless router it gets only a fair signal and can't connect at full speed. 50 feet away in my home office it gets no signal at all. My older pre-N notebook card gets a very good signal in my office so this the one I use even though it can't take advantage of full N1 connection speeds. Don't buy the N1 wireless notebook card, the pre-N is a much better device."
2,"The HB was ok, the special edition is fantastic!","Last winter I read the first half of this book and grinned from ear to ear. ""She's back!"" I thought, ""JM is at her top form again.""Then I read the ending. And I felt so cheated with how abruptly it ended with a HEA that was unbelievable. Lucky for us, JM listened to her fans (and agreed with us), so added some new scenes to the paperback edition. The new scenes flesh out the interaction between Kate and Mitchell and make the ""big misunderstanding"" actually make sense to the reader. Their reconcilliation is believable and touching and made the book so very much better.I only wish I'd waited for the paperback to read this in the first place. If I had, it probably would have rated 5 stars.Oh - you have to read the preview to her next book at the end of the paperback. So great. *dreamy sigh*"
1,Ivory tower drivel,"One must hope that writing this book was part of Martha Craven Nussbaum's healing process following the death of her mother. Apart from this, ""Upheavals of Thought"" is 714 pages spent over-analyzing basic human experience. What is the point? I'll go back to reading Alan Watts, thank you very much. At least that has some practical value."
1,Simply did not work,"Simply did not deliver as promised. I went to the conference, and I found the theology to be unbiblical, useless and with no results. As usual, author blamed everything on lack of my faith etc...Advise: Seek God personally, there are no quick fixes. Anyone who promises you that is offering snake oil. Wallen was right about one thing, Jesus is the final authority and a relationship with the Holy Spirit is of vital importance. The rest is just his views and takes on the origins of soul and demons; which I found to be flawed, contradicting and non biblical.Before I went to the conference I had a good review posted up here, but after having seen for myself, I cannot agree with it anymore."
2,My Favorite Petz,"I purchased this game for my 13 year old daughter and it has provided her with hours!!!! of entertainment. We live on a farm and she really enjoys playing with the ""live"" animals. But on days when the weather is bad and she can't be outside, I can hear the realistic barking and meowing from the computer. She has so many petz that she has to ask me to help think of new names for them. Thank you for such a great product!"
1,Disappointing after reading Pushing Ice,"After reading Pushing Ice, the much shorter Diamond Dogs was a tad disappointing. It lacked depth and character development. A bunch of people head out to explore an alien spire full of puzzles. Get it right, you move on to the next room. Get it wrong, you get sliced and diced. Frankly, its as if Reynolds watched ""The Cube"", and decided to write his own version. The lack of a solid resolution left this story as an empty copy of another idea. Since we never learn anything about the Spire or the aliens who created it, there's nothing original to get lost in and the final ""twist"" is lackluster. I'd pass on this one."
1,Language,I was disappointed in the video because of the foul language. When I saw it on TV the foul language must have been deleted.
1,"Wired is good, but this subscription provider is NOT!","I had already been receiving Wired. When I received an email from Amazon telling me to renew my subscription, I thought $10 is reasonable and worth it for this magazine. I clicked on the link and went ahead to renew. About three days later, I received an official renewal in the mail from Wired for $8! I can't feel but a little bit swindled. Surely the convenience of renewing online is not worth $2 since it is just as simple to write a check and drop it in the mail.Overall, Wired is great, but I'd recommend shopping around first if you are renewing. I will definitely be a little bit more patient next year."
1,Reject Jamaican Homophobia!,"From the Guardian U.K.: ""As a black gay man of Jamaican descent, let me translate a few typical lyrics from the patois. 'Shoot a bullet in a gay man's spine' (Vybz Kartel); 'Queers who get together in a car ... let's burn them, burn them!' (TOK). Biggy C and co's silly remarks are representative of people who care for nothing but having a good time and believe issues like homophobia, sexism and racism are irrelevant. (Ed. Letter, Ted Brown, Chair, Black Lesbians and Gays Against Homophobia)Get your beats elsewhere! Gay men and lesbians are increasingly under attack in Jamaica thanks to dancehall messages like this."
2,A beautiful novel of self-discovery,"I haven't been to Florence in years, but this book certainly evoked wonderful images of the city. However, I was much more entranced with the narrator's emotional journey. I share her philosophy on life -- always wistful for the past, but determined to shape the future. The book is full of interesting artistic, historical and literary references. I enjoyed her interpretation of Ode on a Grecian Urn (Keats) and The Road Not Taken (Frost). There are some hilarious sexual episodes and tender moments with her family and lovers. Altogether a wonderful first novel, and I am eagerly anticipating a second. Try Robertson Davies' ""What's Bred in the Bone"" for a magical book on art and self-discovery. Also, try ""Remains of the Day"" for a different and sadder perspective on choosing which ""path"" to take in life."
1,main stream punk (puke!!),"I have three simple words to discribe Good Charolette....Main Stream Punk...which sucks. Isn't punk supposed to make a statement? Isn't punk supposed to be different...break away from normal everyday crap? Well this music goes against what punk really is. If they are trying to be ""different"" then why are they singing about the same stuff everyone else does, why are they on MTV? They are fake punkers. They WANT to be punk, they try so very hard, but they will never be there with their meaningless lyrics and big attitudes. Yeah, so maybe 8-12 aged kids might like them, the same kids that have all of Brittany Spears, N*SYNC's, and Hilary Duff's cds stacked on their shelves. If you want some REAL punk, check out the Ramones, the WHO, and bands like that. This cd is NOT worth your money!"
2,Enchanted Barbie Doll House,"We purchased this doll house for our granddaughter who ""just had to have it"" for her Barbies. She is four years old and has quite the imagination. We have had a lot of fun watching her play with it and playing with her, as well. It is a great size, perfect for many Barbies to play with at one time. It comes with many accessories, which she loves and folds up for easy storage. It is a perfect compliment for her Barbie collection and a great toy to expand every little girl's, and big girl's imagination."
1,blah,"To each his/her own. I was suckered into buying a case on a Friday sale. I'm now still trying to give them away a package at a time. (You want one???) They are blended, pureed, formed into peapods, but NOT any remote resemblance of an actual green bean. I hate them (although one of my sister-in-laws and parents have ordered 3 more cases). Like I said--to each his/her own. I personally hate them."
2,"After 2-years, still very happy with it thanks to one minor tweak.","For the price, this has been the perfect case for my iBook G4 over the last two years. As noted in another review, the only design flaw is the elastic corner straps, which are not great, but work well once combined with the Velcro I used to keep the laptop and case bottoms and tops together. With that adjustment, I have kept the case on the computer 99% of the time I've owned it, only taking it off at airport security. It can run for hours without heating up the memory foam at all, which makes it more lap-friendly. The memory foam itself is a big advantage over other padded laptop cases I've tried."
1,A Great Disappointment from a Burke Fan,"I was very disappointed in this book, with its incoherent plot -- meanderings is a better term for it. It seems that JLB is getting bored with the Dave Robicheaux character; perhaps his publisher had him in a corner. The characters seem flat, almost prop-like, as if he pulled them out of a Louisiana studio. Although some are, of course, colorful and eccentric, they do not make up for the essential flaw of this book, which is that its plot is confusing and not engaging enough to keep the reader's interest.I am a JLB fan from way back and hope that he can recapture some of his great writing ability."
1,Don't know yet!,"I purchased it to be used with a new phone, but I had problems with the new phone. The initial feedback was it did not sound good. Kept it anyway (should have returned) and I will try it again once I replace the phone."
1,War of the Worlds???,"This movie bears no resemblance whatsoever to the book, which, is a very important thing in this case. First of all, the movie only had FLYING MACHINES. In the book there was just one (flying machine, the rest were tripods)! Secondly, the cheap, nonexistant (in the book) subplots were made so that some ugly 50's hunk could couple up with some preacher's daughter. Remarkably, the old preacher dies! Third, the martians looked like freakin cyborgs with those orbs between their shoulders, the heat-ray effects were terrible, and, to reach my conclusion, THE REAL STORY OCCURRED IN ****ING ENGLAND!!!"
2,TomTom Battery,The item was shipped promptly and the packaging was good. Item was a good price and will come in handy for future use.
1,"""Maybe When I'm Older, I'll Understand The Reason Why"" this single was released.","Why was this song of all of them released? ""Stay In Bed Days"" would have made a better single.01. Today - (4/5) - The worst selling single of the spices (Thank Amber Cafe's poor promotion for that) at #41, this song deserves better but I thought that ""Stay In Bed Days"" or the album title track would have made a better single for this album... It's a great song for those early mornings for work where you get up and are feeling disheveled, yet when you boost the stereo volume in your car, you are suddenly enlightened.02. Bad Bad Girl - (2/5) - Melanie Brown claims on the LA. State of Mind DVD that she loves this song because it goes rock... I hate this song because it goes nowhere... what is it REALLY about? The chorus is what's holding up 2 stars... that's it."
1,"Cute, but does not protect from heat!","I've had this for several months. It's definitely cute and works okay if you're only holding the hot pot/pan for a second or two. Any longer, though, and the heat comes right through to burn your fingertips. This is more a novelty item than a functional kitchen tool."
2,great product,its a great antenna i love it i listen to the radio all the time and i cant get alot of my stations in and now i can thank you for the antenna
2,Best Book,"If you are new to programming or to Visual Basic then simply buy this bookDon't waste your time and money on anything else. Just in short this book isFor peoples those don't know any thing about Visual Basic, Guarantee in oneWeek you will be able to do your own programmes.Good LuckAnd Good Work John"
2,So Nice,"This bread machine is so right on. The whole house will smell good and you will use it often. The down side- the pan on this machine does loose a little coating. I am a health nut and am not too worried by this as it is minor. I have been really careful washing the pan, but still a little coating loss! I wish this did not happen!!!! But the machine is overwhelmingly worth its price, but Zojirushi should improve their pan! Bread 5 stars, pan 4.3 stars.Also for really good bread purchase The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook by Beth Hensperger. I tried the Zojirushi cookbook that comes with the product, and the bread was OK, but the dream was not realized. This book has great recipes and tells you about things that make the bread good, if you like and can eat wheat, like vital wheat gluten available in most stores."
1,Buyers beware! Lack of manufacturer's support,"I have owned the Atomix Clock for over 2 months. The clock would die after a week of use. It seems that the battery gets drained fairly quickly (I have been feeding it a single fresh AA alkaline battery each week). It's possible that this is just an isolated case. What really disturbs me is that my requests for support, through voice and email, have gone unanswered - when calling their 1-800 support number, you are put into a voice mailbox; their online email support promises a 24-hour turnaround. Thus far, I have not heard back from them. This is rather pathetic."
2,A versatile mute,Most trombonist don't use mutes because they usually don't fit in the trombone case. If you are going to bring a mute to the gig in my opinion the Clear tone Trombone Mute is your best choice. Use it with a plunger and you have a cup mute and play into softly and it works as a straight mute.
2,i like it,Exactly what i was looking for ! exelent price and i receive it very quicky even i live in Honduras!
1,Lose this book beneath the layer,This book is suffering from massive technical and terminological problems. There are simply too many to begin to list them. It's like the Naval Institute Proceedings meets the Ladies' Home Journal...and loses. It's riddled with errors fore and aft. I reached a point of discouragement where I simply couldn't read another word. I give it one star for effort...not a good effort.
2,Dare to know,"This book is good. It is good because it amuse you. It is good because it teach you (or at least it challenges you to investigate and learn in the process), and it is good because it has a good story in it. This book is not a nobel prize, it is a novel, just that. But be careful, if you are a devoted christian, a strict catholic practicant or a religious fanatic, this may not be for you."
2,Rodan you bet,Rodan is a complete story. It includes people elements and the state of the arts special effects for the times. I have been looking for a clear copy of this film and this is it.
2,So far it's great,"I researched tons of vacuums before purchasing this one. I wanted the best I could get for around $100. This is the first time I've owned a bagless vacuum and I was a bit concerned that it would be messy to empty it. Turns out not to be a problem. Everything detaches easily. If you were to open it over the garbage and shake it out, then some of the dust will fly around cause of the shaking. I just set it in a plastic bag, open, and lift it up and everything comes out mess free in the bag. The automatic cord rewind thing was not a selling point for me when I purchased it, but now I don't ever want to own a vacuum without it - it's so convenient. I gave it four stars only because it is a little bit heavy, but not too much to be a problem for me."
1,Stainless steel?,"I have had my knives about six months and they look more like rust than s/s. Also, they are about as sharp as a bowling ball and make slicing through soft butter a chore."
2,Best econ book!,"This book is an outstanding book, which uses a lot of graphs and good explanations! I used this book as my subtext because my econ teacher chose a very lame online book, which doesn't have as many graphs and pictures as this book has. This book explains concepts in a very clear and organized way to help you better understand. I really wanted to say ""thank you"" to the author!"
2,Perfect fit,"My husband made a cradle for our son and when it came time to buy a sheet that fit it wasn't an easy task. I tried several stores in the area and I wasn't able to find one. Once I received the Koala Baby cradle sheet I was a little reluctant about whether or not it would fit. However, once I put it on the mattress, not only did it fit perfectly it was also very soft."
1,??,I haven't figured out how to get it to work yet. Is it necessary to have a wireless router? I don't have one. Does that mean I can't make this product work?
1,Atlantic mounts,Not bad for light speakers. My Cambridge Soundworks 155 at 8 pounds or so are to heavy. The ball rotates on the rod that is embeded in it. It happened on all five mounts. To bad the rest is pretty good. 24 bucks in the trash for me.
2,PIXIES/MODEST MOUSE? no comparison.,"While I do love this record the Pixies far surpass MM in terms of greatness. This is definitly worth buying but if you don't have Surfer rosa yet, go get it, for the love of god, go get the greatest indie album ever!"
1,Disappointment,The author attempts to lead inexperienced coaches down a path of genious only to complicate the subject. The triangle thing is not a good method.
2,You get what you pay for!,"As in most cases you get exactly what you pay for with the Canon Battery Pack. You can find plenty of cheaper battery packs but none will offer the superior performance, reliability, and longevity provided by the Canon Battery. In the long run when you by the cheaper battery packs you end up paying more for less capablity."
2,Good value,"This little contraption does what I need it to do and was a good purchase for the money. Easy to install and, so far, so good."
1,CAUTION: This CD is aight--much better artists out there....,"Might I recommend going to CDStreet and buying either SEAN-GEMINI or KEITH WOLFE instead? ""G"" has good production, but you'll see the difference when you hear their stuff--no contest. They both have great CDs available and they didn't use spam to get it to the public"
1,good looks is deceiving,"If you want to have fun don not buy this game is just like ninja gaiden, HARD!!!!!!!!!!!! if you want just good looks this is the game"
2,So far so good.,"I order this part(2 valves) for my 2000 Chevyrado, the service engine soon light came on, I connected my OBD2 scanner and gave me code P1416, I did some research for help on the web and most of the sites recommended to replaced this part, some others said it was an oxygen sensor so I took my chances and decided to go for the valve, it was easy to install, a bolt off bolt on job. I installed the valves (drivers & passenger side ) right after I receive it (shipping was fast) erased the code after and until now the on board light hasn't come back, so far so good. Good price and packaging from Amazon."
2,An Educational Tool for Many Professions,"Finally, it seems we are able to take advantage of Karen Taylor's wealth of experience and expertise in the latest professional text. After hiring Karen to teach in the classroom, we as educators are pleased to see that some of the training conducted for professionals now has this valuable learning tool. Imagine the difference it can make to have the text available to accompany the hands-on instruction. The best of both worlds.I'm certain that the excellent presentation of material, coupled with the easy-to-follow information will keep the novice reader and professional artist involved from cover to cover. And it should hold a proud spot on everyone's shelf as a learning resource for years to come."
2,Fun game for kids,"I got this for my 4yo and she loves it. I do agree that the color names that they have put on the cards are weird, but we just call them my names that my kid understands. The shape is very cute, it does make it a bit hard to learn to shuffle the first few times, but it just takes doing it a few times. The cards are more sturdy than I expected which was a nice surprise. Kids can still bend them so we keep them out of reach of my 2 yo, but they aren't easily bent. They also come in a nice study case so it is easy to keep them contained"
2,All Joe Scruggs,I am 14 years old and still love listening to this guy. I have been listening to him for as long as I can remember.
1,cheated,"I ordered 1-black & 1-tan envelope, I got the black one ten days later with 2 day air. The tan never arrived,so I emailed 4 times no response , that was 2 months ago on 1/16/2009 the order was paid. the envelope was nice but I at least expect a refund or the product or notice of back order. The product is still being offered by seattle gift shop as available."
1,Cordless Grass Shear,Was unable to use item since I have a bad back. The extension handle was never set for this item. I would not have ordered this item if I knew I would not get the extension handle.
2,A wonderful book for beginners,This book provides a comprehensive discussion and integration of career development theories. The instructor's manual assists the beginning professor with an opportunity to impart quality pedagogical knowledge to students. The examples cited throughout the text offer students an opportunity ingest the course material and retain their newly found knowledge. The author makes learning career theories enjoyable and very applicable to situations.
2,Way to go Garth!,Wow Garth has done it again another wonderful Christmas cd and maybe one of his best cd in a while. He always has great cds and boy what a great cd this is. From Let it Snow to Winter Wonderland hes got all the great Christmas songs to make it feel like Christmas before it's even hear. I recommend every one to buy this Christmas album and to prove it it debuyed number 1 on the Billboards for Christmas cd.
2,An amazing record by an amazing band.,"This is by far their best album. All of the songs just make me glad, even though to most people it saddens the mood. I like the riffs and screaming in this album much more than in their more recent ones. Defenitly a great buy."
2,Masetto Is Hot!,"This is the best performance of Don Giovanni that I have seen yet.Except for a little backround noise, it was really great.I loved Thomas Allen's and Natale De Carolis's singing.The sets were also very nice.I happen to think that Zerlina was a little smarmy, but she sang well.This opera was recorded nicely,and I would reccomend it to anyone.I wish I saw it live!"
2,China CEO Is On Target,"This is a MUST READ for anyone desiring to conduct business in China. We are the first American university to partner with the Chinese government to deliver university education in Tianjin. I wish this had been available 3 years ago when we began our project in Tianjin. Every page is right on! I just ordered 6 copies for my management team.Joe WestDeanSchool of Hospitality and Tourism ManagementFlorida International UniversityMiami, FL, USA"
1,A feminist-minded thriller descends into ho-hum romance,"FG started out interesting -- a unique, feminist protagonist whom Frase portrays with surprsing sympathy and insight. Too bad she gradually transforms into a bland, romance-genre heroine with no backbone. The Kasey at the beginning would have hated the Kasey at the end."
2,Masterpiece,Very enjoyable read. This is the first Verne book I have read and now I want to read them all. How would you survive on an island? Old world wisdom is shared within a chronology...
2,Lead free but....,I needed an OER factory style terminal so I could properly attach the factory harness to the other electrical components. This terminal fits and serves its purpose but I don't know why they chose to use standard zinc plated nuts & bolts. It seems to me that the nuts and bolts will eventually corrode and fail. I would have given it 5 stars if they used brass nuts & bolts.
1,Torn,"I am torn with this purchase. From day one our older chocolate lab loved this bed and it seemed to ease arthritis pain. The younger dog in the house and visiting dogs also loved it. Unfortunately, it has been under two months and the middle of the bed has sagged considerably, so it needs replacing. I expected more for $140.I would rate this bed as five stars if the product held up --- alas....."
1,Don't Bother,I LOVE LOVE LOVED The Boy Next Door and Boy Meets Girl and was totally pumped for a new Meggin Cabot novel. Every Boy's Got One was flat out awful. I couldn't even bear to finish it. I still love Meggin Cabot but this book was a giant disappointment!
1,What was with this?,"For some reason with the sampler, it has no soul and intensity. The orchestra played some of his most energetic songs 'boooooom, boom boom' instead of 'bambam bam boom bam bam bam'. Okay. Ignore that. Johann is an excellent composer. However, this orchestra defeated the"
1,boring,"The book was OK...but, it didn't keep me reading (I had to struggle to finish it) It was seemed like it was just taken from an OLD book & not really for today's readers. I was hoping for something MORE & this just wasn't it."
2,Very Bright!,"Ok, so i mounted this on my sport ATV yesterday, and although the instructions say connect one of the wires to the negative post on mt ATV battery and the other wire to the ATV accessories shoe , i connected both wires to negative and positive. I did this because logically looking at the set up, it seemed the only way to connect the thing. Low and behold my battery died in like 15 minutes out on the trail. I give this 5 stars because it mounts good, very bright, and a great price. Because i followed my own instructions i am going to blame myself, not the light for a dead battery..."
2,Fantastic,Consumer Reports rated this iron as a best buy...comparable to a much more expensive Rowenta...this iron is truly fantastic. Heats up quickly with a ton of steam. The ultraglide is very smooth as well...two thumbs up!!
2,Milwaukee Products,Purchased a Milwaukee circular saw thru Amazon. Price and service were excellent. As I expected the saw performs better than others I have owned!
2,Highly recommended,My 3yr old son loves Bubble Guppies. I think the show is so adorable and very educational. I just wish they would put more episodes on DVD.
1,Information Technology Consulant,I returned these items once I received them without using them so I can't comment on the sound quality or ease of use. On opening the packaging I found an insert that stated there were high levels of lead used within the manufacturing. Wish I could have used a negative number in the rating. As these will be used in a University Computer lab I felt that it was unsafe to use. I returned them without issue and received a refund promptly.
2,Amistades Peligrosas Rocks my face off!,"This Group ROCKS!!!!!!! I LOVE THEM!!!This group is totally unique and awesome! Some of the songs are slow and sultry, and some are upbeat enough to workout. And, the guy's voice is unbelievably sexy! And fun to dance to!"
2,Great Collection,Excellent collection of the old train songs and the people that produced them. Got to me on time and the condition was just as described.
2,Great Product!,"This truly gives such a wonderful finish. I have many make up brushes to apply foundation with and even with much blending, leaves my skin not as flawless as this beauty blender. I give it four stars because I do wash them after every use and the last time I was cleaning I lightly scratched it to get some extra foundation off and a piece of the actual beauty blender came off. Be extra gentle while cleaning. It is pricey, and it is a great make up tool, but I hope they hold up for a while for the price."
1,"Quite un-Seuss illustrations, VERY un-Seuss rhymes.","The rhymes start out strong; proper Seussian lickety-split, with humor in each line. But by the time ""Finagle the Agent"" shows up it's just cliche and banal stuff that I can't believe Seuss ever wrote himself. You get the sense that somebody else finished it. He certainly never illustrated it, and the inclusion of the Cat-in-the-Hat as narrator seems weird; he has no purpose in the story. This is the very first in a long string of sell-outs that Suess' widow has committed over the years."
1,This garbage can is GARBAGE,"Length:: 1:07 MinsLook - this thing doesn't work anymore. This claim, ""if you open your can 20 times a day, it can last over 10 years. This could actually be the last trashcan you ever buy, which will save you money, mess, and time."" is an OUTRIGHT LIE. This garbage can lid worked for about 15 months at best. It no longer opens wide enough to put trash in, and the lid only stays up for a second, if that. Totally useless, overpriced terrible product."
2,Much better than I dared hope,"I haven't read Dune in 10-15 years, but this prequel felt/read like the original to me. Dad would be proud."
2,Great aviation DVD,"One Six Right gets it right. In telling the story of Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles, it tells the story of American general aviation. It's beautifully shot and is very nicely directed. From interviews with many pilots in the LA area, the audience gets a great sense of what makes American grass-roots aviation unique.I found myself thinking this is the best movie I've seen that tries to tell non-flyers why they should care about general aviation policy in the US, but that it also could do better. It's a small nag, because telling that story is a very hard thing to pull off, and One Six Right does it better than anyone else.And besides that, it conveys the strongest sense of why flyers love to fly."
2,Just what I expected.,I liked this stain. It was easy to apply and the results were very good.I would recommend this product.
2,A Really Good DVD!!,"Fat-Free Yoga is probably the best yoga DVD for weightloss on the market, and the only one that makes any sense! It has a cardio element, it works on the glands and other areas that standard exercises don't address at all, including the REASONS that cause a person to become overweight.Ana and Ravi are very encouraging and you feel like they are really on your side and sincerely want you to lose the unwanted weight. On top of all that, they even manage to make the workout fun!Even though I no longer need to lose weight, Fat-Free Yoga remains one of my favorite DVDs. It has a ton of stuff I like to do. I enjoy all four 'short' programs (each about 20 minutes) and while it's active, it's not So Challenging that you can't do it if you're a ""regular"" person, which I am. I'm so glad I have it because it works well as an add-on to other kundalini routines or as a long, more intense workout by itself."
2,Great way to enjoy popcorn. Healthy and fun.,"I am so glad I purchased this. After hearing all of the news about microwave popcorn, I decided to try some hot air corn. This popper works great! It does occasionally throw out a half dozen kernels before popping begins, but I just quickly toss them back in the mix (if they're not too hot yet). It takes about 30 secs or so to get warmed up, but then popping begins and you have a bowl full of corn in about 1 minute. Still as fast as a microwave, and BETTER for you."
1,The audio sounds like a counterfeit knock-off,"Arrived on time and well packed. The picture is okay--a little grainy--but the sound is terrible. It sounds like it was recorded by holding a microphone in front of a TV, and it has a strange tinny sound. It is basically unusable. It's our Christmas tradition to watch this film so we ended up getting our old video player out of storage and watching a VHS tape of the movie instead."
2,Kismet,"Again by Sharon Cullars (4.5)Tyne is a mid-thirties career woman who has struck out in love time and again. But her days are distracted by the erotic visits she receives every night from a handsome stranger --- who meets her in her dreams.David can't seem to escape from the hold his dreams have on him. His life is spiraling out of control from the incessant pull of a mystery woman. But there's something else just beneath the surface; a truth that could shatter everything he thought he knew about himself.Again by Sharon Cullars allows readers a glimpse into the past and the present with a healthy dose of pure desire. Eloquently laced with the pull of soul mate desire, Again is a taste of something extraordinary."
2,VCR makes too much noise,"The TV and DVD fuctions are great. The only problem I have is when I watch a VHS there is a loud hum while a tape is inside (Playing or not) the unit. That hum makes it impossible to covertly watch an adult movie without getting caught by your spouse. Also, when you hit stop the unit makes a loud noise. The DVD portion is quiet and the transition back to a cable channel is fast and soundless. Bottom Line. If you are watching something you don't your wife to know about use the DVD. Still a good buy for a bedroom TV. I also have it hooked up to my mini sound system and it looks and sounds great."
1,I Didn't Laugh Once,"I'm glad other buyers found this DVD hilarious, but I thought it was relentlessly unfunny. I bought it for my brother-in-law for Christmas, since he loves Hawaii and all the reviews were positive. We tried to watch it last night. To start with, Rap's speech pattern is difficult to understand and the muddy soundtrack doesn't help. His ""jokes"" are terrible and his sketches look like something a failing student would produce with all his stoner buddies in a High School Audio/Visual class. There wasn't a single moment of wit or insight. You're better off spending ten minutes finding funny stuff on YouTube than wasting your money on this."
2,Nice watch,"This watch works as expected. It is kind of chunky, but since I wanted it for casual wear that is not a problem. I sure wish we could still get the old-fashioned watches that need to be wound up. When I get dressed up and want to wear a watch, it would be fantastic to be able to have a smaller, occasional-wear watch that hasn't run out of batteries while sitting in my jewelry drawer!"
1,Major Disappointment,"Loved ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"" and ""Heartstone"", but this book was a major disappointment, especially considering how well it started out. The plot as well as several of the major characters were completely far-fetched, and I knew how it would end half way through the book. Sorry I wasted my time and money."
1,Needs updating,"This book is now old - originally published in 96. Java haschanged significantly since then. The major impact to theusefulness of this book is the Java3D API.Positives: The book does a good job of starting with simplergames and then adding additional features such as networkinglater. It also mixes in useful material on theory suchas BSPs, ray casting, and texture mapping.On the whole, I would not recommend buying this book now."
1,wrong product,"They will send you 70% cocoa lindt chocolate but it has a ""new recipe"". It's 30 calories more a serving, all sugar, and takes like crappy milk chocolate you'd get in a cheap easter bunny. Has none of the cocoa bite that it used to. This is kind of sad, since this chocolate used to be the best readily available dark chocolate on the market.If you're looking for a dark chocolate that's kind of low in carbs, this isn't it. Save yourself some money and buy a hersey bar."
2,Great product and the seller was great,I ordered the cases for my son's birthday and we received it in a short time. They were received in great condition. I was very happy with the purchase.
1,Alamo-philes will probably LOVE it,"Chariton is another writer who is obsessed with the Alamo and this takes away from what this book could have been. Chariton is DETERMINED TO PROVE that Crockett fell fighting ala John Wayne/Fess Parker and this takes up a good portion of the book. Wallace, GET OVER IT ! Chariton even has a photo of Wayne taken from the film THE ALAMO and tries to compare Wayne and Crockett ! This gives you an idea of the mentality of the writer and this book ! If he had left out these silly comparisons, this would be a more readable work. Historians of the Mexican side of the Texas War will notice how Chariton seems to ignore or even discredit the Mexican sources. Ahem, Mr. Chariton, do I detect a bit of ""anti-Mexican"" sentiment here ? Yes, we KNOW you are a ""NATIVE TEXAN"" Mr. Chariton, you remind us constantly. But if you wanted to make this a BETTER book, you should have spent more time in FACT, not opinion. And just a little reminder, THE MEXICANS WON AT THE ALAMO !"
1,Waste of $,We actually never were able to entirely build the desk. Although shipped what seemed securely there were several parts damaged including the desk top being split down the middle. The replacement parts ordered directly through the manufacturer did not line up with the desk proprely. The desk top didn't fit properly on the desk top itself. Don't waste your time or money! I have a very disappointed kid that has no desk and a walletwaiting for my refund.
2,Light and funny,I actually laughed outload in some parts. The elevator scene was priceless. A great book for a easy read for a weekend.
2,A Simple Clear Guide to Manifestation,"I really enjoyed this book because it was brief, direct, concrete and offered clear worksheets that you could personalize (for yourself or for coaching clients). I think the inner work of changing your beliefs and vibration is very important in manifestation. The one thing I would have liked included was an emphasis on action as well-ie: 'I am a famous actor AND I am actively applying for auditions.' Many Law of Attraction books seem to leave out this action part."
1,what happened? soles and heel coming unstuck,"These shoes were good quality when I bought them at a department store a couple years ago. The leather held up well, retained its shine, resisted scuffing. Also, the look is simple, unadorned. I sought out the exact Donald J. Pliner ""Rex"" model to purchase again at Amazon when it time came to replace my old pair.Well, something's changed. I ordered this pair early August 2012, and a little over a month in, maybe 9 wears, they are not holding together well. The sole of the shoe is composed of layers of material, and the layers are separating visibly near the big toe. The same thing is happening with the back heel. Unacceptable quality."
1,Junk!,"I used a friends older model and it worked like a charm. He is a super of 470 units, got it as a gift and uses it all the time for years now. I purchased this one and it worked one time and then the insides fell apart! Not worth returning it and not worth buying it either. You can buy a high quality stainless one. It will pay for itself in no time. This thing is a joke! Don't buy it."
2,Heartbreaking and Lovely,"This is such a wonderful book on so many levels. This book contains a beautiful love story, complicated family dynamics and fascinating depictions of WWII. The main character, Tatiana is seventeen living in Leningrad Russia with her family just as Germany begins to invade in the east. Tatiana is living in a communal housing building and sharing a two room apartment with six family members. As the war begins in their country the family is scrambling to figure out what to do. Meanwhile Tatiana meets Alexander, a soldier in the Red Army. They quickly discover that they have an unbreakable connection however they also soon discover something that may (and should?) keep them apart forever.This is such a wonderful story. Those who love romance, love, and historical fiction will LOVE this book."
1,"If you enjoy Wheel of Fortune, DON'T BUY THIS!!","We own WOF 1 and have a lot of fun with it. So, we figured the 2nd edition would be even better, right? Wrong. Vanna looks like some 2-year-old cut her cardboard picture off a cereal box and pasted her on the cheesy, fake-looking background. The sound stinks, the game play is nauseatingly slow. I will say this, however. The graphics on the CD cover are pretty good, and the box itself has an attractive layout. It will look really good on the shelf of your computer desk -- which is where you will leave it when you uninstall it from your hard drive after you suffer through your first game."
1,You get what you pay for: keep or get standard DVD of these titles for now,"Imagine my surprise seeing these two films bundled together on Blu-ray at an unbelievable price! I would have to agree with the other reviewers of the Blu-ray versions that both films seem to have a soft focus and lack in sharpness. I was hoping that Blu-ray would be the ultimate viewing experience but it isn't - yet (I'm hoping for a new issue that fixes this problem in the future). For now, you are better off just seeing the standard definition DVDs of these 2 films upconverted to 1080p."
2,Entertaining read and a treat for skating fans,"Who can fail but sympathize with Ms. Baiul, an anomaly in this glittering sport of young women who usually have it all - looks, money, and loving families. That Oksana managed to achieve greatness with none of the above says it all about her talent. Oksana's fans won't be disappointed."
1,Warning: Not for all moms,"This book had some practical ideas that aren't very new. Such as having a schedule and such. But I had a hard time, as I was reading the book, believing that her ideas on a schedule were realistic with nursing babies and homeschooling. Certain personality types will struggle with this book, others will probably love it. I didn't feel very encouraged or excited or motivated by reading this book. I suppose it just wasn't written for my personality. I learned alot more and felt more encouraged by other books such as MOTH (Managers of their home) and Emily Barnes books. Good luck!"
2,A good investment!,"A friend of mine bought this book. She spoke highly of it. Then I had an opportunity to browse through it at my leisure. I found myself reading the whole thing, word-for-word, all 100 pages, in one sitting. I was inspired! I immediately began to employ Tom Lynch's lessons to my painting technique. This was yesterday. I need some practice, but I found that I really needed the inspiration of this book to loosen up. The flip-chart format appealed to me, as well as the pictorial demonstration style. I plan to purchase this book and use it as a ready reference in my studio."
2,Good 3D,Once I bought a 3D player.....it is great.....I also have LG Smart 3D Plasma and the HD version converts to almost the same quality....so buy if your TV and Player has 3D or you plan on it soon...otherwise...the HD version is just as good...
2,Space Above and Beyond,"Great series that never quite had a chance for an audience share. If you take the old series Combat and Star Trek, you would end up with something similar. A good cast brings the characters to life. References to current social problems and historical events makes it all a little more real."
2,If you only plan to buy one CD this year BUY THIS!,"Easily the most incredible album I've heard so far this year. Rick Wakeman combines the best aspects of both Rock and Classical Music styles and in the process has given the term 'Symphonic Rock' a new meaning with this CD. The Rock aspect of the album is definitely Classic in every sense of the word, and the Classical aspect most definitely Rocks!While Rick Wakeman more than merits Five Stars for this album, so do the guest singers on this CD, although Ozzy Osbourne and Trevor Rabin stand head and shoulders above the rest and as for Patrick Stewart ... well, this album would not be the same were it not for him."
1,The Outsiders,"The book i read was called the outsiders written by S.E Hilton. The theme is about a group of kids called the greasers. The greasers are made up of Ponyboy,Sodapop,Dallas,Twobit and Johnny. There is a battle in between the soc short for the socials and the greasers.It takes place in Oklahoma.When Johnny and Sodapop get assuated by some socs one day end up fighting. Johnny kills a soc. So Johnny and Sodapop runaway so the police does not find them. And at the end of the story Johnny dies."
2,donation,"At first I bought these to give to a grandson with ""SANFORD"" as a middle name. then I bought more to give to the local school!"
1,Couldn't get into the book; left it unfinished,"Title of review says it all - just could not get past the socio--political commentary enough to get interested in the book, much less finish it. Will be going on the the next trip to the local used book store. Not Recommended"
2,Always Excellent,"NYPD Blue is, was and always will be reliably excellent television programming. It's a shame it ended...but fortunately for us, we have the opportunity to have each season so wonderfully preserved!"
2,Nice,Bought this for a friend and he loves it. This item is good to have if you are a guiter player.
2,Bruce is the best...,"Received TRACKS for Christmas from my wife and I have been listening to it non stop. Lots of B sides that bring back memories of my college days, hanging out with my buddies Sabu, O'T and the Kid at the local gin mill trying to pick up girls..anyway back to reality. I only wish I had two copies, one for home and one for the car."
1,INACURATE READINGS,I USED THIS FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS BEFORE I FOUND OUT THAT IS VERY INACURATE AS MUCH AS 5 LBS.
2,christmas cottage,"my husband loves this movie. it is definatley for all ages, nothing to worry about the kids seeing, or swear words."
1,what is the deal,"The book which is ostensibly about a murder and a murder trial obsessively wanders off in all directions. Any time a noun appears--IWW, Pinkerton, baseball, theatre, etc. the author spends 50-100 pages telling us about a new subject. we don't even get to the trial for nearly 500 pages and then the treatment is inadequate.Common Ground was an awe-inspiring work. I found this to be terribly disappointing."
1,P4s last lap.,"Minimum replacement for a 478 pin / P4 you still want to get some use from. It's not my old Abit IS7, but hey, it's cheap. One sound channel arrived DOA. RMA'd. Replacement taking 3 months arrive. No idea what's going on with that, but they're letting me keep (using) the old one in the mean time. Suprised by their flexibility. Nice suprise, for a change. Thx."
1,Barnett Outdoors Diablo Slingshot with Stabilizers,-5***** I bought one of these for my husband and it still has not arrived. Cannot locate who or how to contact the seller to resolve this issue. It says that the item has been delivered but it has not. Please contact me so I can update my comments.5 Stars!!! Bought these for four girls and they were so excited on Christmas Day. They made great stocking stuffers and kept them busy for a long time.... or so their parents said.
2,An excellent guide to the subject,"Kate Decker shows truly impressive insight into how animals think and behave in ""101 Training Tips."" It's a welcome addition to my sizeable collection of guides to caring for dogs. Her advice has been most effective on a very difficult doberman pinscher that I recently adopted. I had tried out a variety of techniques in hopes of correcting the pinscher's more aggressive behaviors, but Ms. Decker's tips worked best. I've recommended ""101 Tips"" to friends who've had similar good results."
1,Dumb book,"This was a dumb book, very elementary information, very generalized and inaccurate personality types, just a disappointing buy. I had seen her talk on a TV show and thought it would be better."
2,They work,"They work as well as vacuum bags do. They collect trash, filter out dust and do whatever else is needed."
1,Impluasible Attack from a Has-Been,"An outrageous attack on his President when his country is engaged in a war on terrorism from a man who was formerly an insider and a trusted member of the Administration. A sad example of a failed bureaucrat treacherously telling tales, many of them ""tale tales"", apparently for revenge. Interestingly the tales told in this book are but one of several different versions told to reporters and to the private sessions of the 9/11 investigation committee. A caution to all readers: This is NOT a reliable source!"
2,FF9 takes the best from both worlds,"I have not played anything before FF7, so I'm comparing this game to FF7 and FF8. Final Fantasy 9 takes 7's storyline quality and 8's graphics and scenes and puts them together in one box. The basic battle system makes it challenging in the game as well as giving you the freedom of equiping your characters, which is the great feeling you get from FF8. Final Fantasy 9 is easily my favorite RPG game and will only be topped by another Final Fantasy realese...."
1,Small Town? Small premise!,"Let me start by saying that I own everything that Lawrence Block has published. That out of the way, let me say this: What did he think was pulling this story together? There is no compelling theme, no protagonist, no cogency as he flits from one character to another without any particular purpose. The sex is a poor substitute for plot mechanisms. Was he writing in the hopes of selling the book for conversion to a soft core movie producer? Was he in a rush to bring out the defining post 9/11 NYC novel? Whatever the motivation, the finished product just does not reflect the level of expertise and craftsmanship that Block has demonstrated in other efforts. What a disappointment."
1,Great premise but left a little frustrated,"This is a great premise of a story. I did enjoy the sections based in both Laura's world and the city but on the whole I found the book frustrating.It is true, you do start to realise there is not going to be a happy ending and the end of the book is so obvious that you do feel a little let down in the last few pages.Some of this book is beautifully written and some of the characters are wonderful but in contrast I found other parts of the book boring - I disliked the sections of the religious man's life and indeed the last chapter of Laura's.Maybe it just wasn't for me but I got to the end and felt - what was the point?If you find a copy try reading it - maybe this will be somebody's little gem of a book."
2,Creative still rules the PC audio realm,"Creative once again lives up to their name with the Live X-Gamer. The Live cards are all the same physically. The real difference is in the packaged software, save the Platinum version which includes the Live Dock(A very cool feature). I sort of miss the Gold plated RCA jacks from the SoundBlaster Gold days, but I'll deal.The sound quality from this card is what most would expect from the leader in computer audio products. The included software is a great deal by giving you: Descent Three, Need For Speed:High Stakes(my fave), and Thief. The applications for the card sometimes seem a bit much, but they are a joy to audiophiles, and those who like to play around with digital audio.Install was trouble free and with the easy update features I was able to get on-line and update the card without a hassle.The reasonable price and gratuitous software bundle make this a definate consideration for those looking to build a system or upgrade an older sound card."
2,Excellent Dry pads,"i purchased this product as i loved the 1st one i received as a gift. it fashionable and durable, easy to wash and dry and it doesn't become damaged. a must buy"
1,Gets boring fast,"The workout is repetitive and gets boring very fast especially if you are used to high-paced workouts. Leisa Hart narrates with a too peppy and somewhat condescending tone which gets annoying.The yoga section is not neccessarily yoga and has no calming results.I suggest Prenatal Yoga for an interesting, great workout in any stage of pregnancy!"
2,Author deceased over 25 years now and still teaching!!!!!,"Wow!!!!!This book was one of my top 10 favorite reads of all time.It was so interesting to read about his initial failure as a life insurance salesman, and the steps he took to overcome. I enjoyed the steps he took to overcome his shy/nervousness when in the presence of clients...especially wealthy/powerful clients.I enjoyed the quotes. He stated, ""Insurance sales is the easiest job in the world,if you work it HARD;but, it is the hardest job in the world if you work it EASY."" Another quote in his book, ""In this world we either discipline ourselves, or we are disciplined by the world, and I prefer to discipline myself."""
1,Horrible surface noise,"Mine was also slightly off center,but I couldn't hear that defect.The big problem is the horrific and almost constant surface noise.I had many ordinary records back in the seventies that were super quiet.For this,or any price this pressing is just junk.Audiophile pressing?Don't make me laugh."
2,Stout KVMP switch. Works great,"One of the things I like about the ExtremeX series of IOGear KVM switches is their weight. They stay where you put them and when you need to push a button, which isn't too often, the unit stays put. I have hooked up 3 different computers to my 4 port IOGear KVMP and am able to quickly switch from system to system either by typing the shift code on my wireless KB or pressing the appropriate switch on the box. It has always worked. I can recommend this KVMP if you have 3 or 4 systems you want to use with one set of keyboard, mouse, monitor, and peripherals."
1,"Not squirrl proof, seed pours out","I have had this about a year, the feeding ports that switch from thistle feed to sunflower seed have been completely chewed up by either the birds or the squirrels. So now when I try to fill the feeder the seed simply pours out all over the ground. This was a gift, I do not have any warranty information and cannot find any info on the company for any replacement parts. It's a shame because I hate to just throw it out, before they ate through the ports it worked great, all my birds loved it. The squirrels can get into it so you do need other baffels for them.I do agree that it should not be advertised as ""copper"". It is copper colored plastic. This was not an issue for me, but I can see how it would be for others if they did not read carefully.Anyone have any contact information on the company so I can try to get replacement parts?"
2,Superlative Read!,"King takes his readers through his life, peppering amongst the biographical detail his insights into his writing craft. I bought this book a few years ago for a university writing course for my step-daughter. She recommended I read it, so I purchased my own copy. I'm glad I did because it's a book that ought to be read by aspiring writers with a pen in hand for marginal notes or asterisks.A most novel (pardon the pun) approach to writing about writing indeed. The book is part biography, part tips for the aspiring writer, woven into a truly entertaining read. Highly recommended!"
2,We need to get this man more attention!! He is great.,"Let me just say record companies who passed him up are making a mistake. This is quality real life good music. As is all of Rhett's music. ""That Girl"" is a song all of us guys seem to relate to and it makes us smile. Rhett is so right in ""Trouble With a Woman"". This is a perfect CD to listen to with your dad while out fishing or driving around the countryside with your high school buddies. And there are the songs that you will want your girl by your side as well. ""Livin' Right"" is my favorite song of all time! It is my story. It's beautiful. Everyone get this because you'll enjoy it and we owe it to the great Rhett."
1,Very Disappointed,"With all the great reviews, I thought once again I would try something to help my nails grow. I applied the cream 3 to 4 times a day. I even took my polish off, hoping that would help. My nails are now more of a mess than when I started. I am truly disappointed."
1,Extremely low volume,"Even with the volume cranked, I could barely hear the audio from this unit. I thought it was defective and returned it, but after investigating further on cell phone forums on CNET, I found it was a common issue. Beware!"
2,logitech trackman wheel,This is better than any mouse I have ever used and I hate going back to the old style mouse I use at work. I wish they had this available as a high performance gaming mouse. I bought one of those high dollar ones and I don't like it nearly so much as the trackman wheel.
1,KEEP the Box - You'll need to RETURN it,"This is now my THIRD Rowenta Steam Generator Iron. After only 5 months, this one stopped working too. It gets quite expensive to keep returning these. If it's out of warranty, then the cost to repair is more than the cost of a new one. Oh, how I miss my Euro Pro......"
2,PE beginnings...,"This reprint of Drew Hayes' oringinal Mulehide Graphics Poison Elves series is quite well done. While those who are only familiar with his later works would see the trade paper back as crude and not well practiced, others will definately relish in all the history it has to offer. The later comics do hint at what is contained in the earlier issues, but it is best to read it here and get all the details in full black and white. Further, it is always enjoyable to see where a favorite comic started and how it has evolved to what it is today. That is probablly what makes this book most enjoyable."
2,"Simple, functioning cable.","If you just need a cable for your ipod nano 4th gen for a line out signal to a mini connector for use in your front car auxiliary port, then this cable has exactly what you need and nothing that you don't.The cable is just the right length so you can confortably find the songs you need on your ipod while it's connected to your car aux port, without a bunch of additional cable snaking over your console and/or seat.If you're looking for a cable that charges your ipod and allows you to connect it to an audio input at the same time, this cable is not for you, but if you don't mind relying in the battery power then this cable is perfectly fine."
2,Among the best in years,"An obscure historical incident provides the occasion for this insightful literary work. It does more than transport to another time and culture, or put you in proximity with strong personalities; it forces you to look at a philosophical or ethical issue straight in the face. The rudiments of this novel are flawless; more importantly it reaches for a thematic ambiguity that can just barely be articulated. Except in a literary work of this quality."
1,This toy barely works.,"This etch-a sketch appeared to be similar to the one of my youth. The toy can not draw a picture. The nobs barely move to create lines, so that the picture as shown on the object could never be made with this toy. The grains simply become a dark gray shower across the board and nothing else. The toy was very disappointing. Since it was a gift for my grandson, it was difficult to take this toy and return it. I would not suggest purchasing it."
1,Returned it!,"Quick service, professionally done and on time.Only one DVD had sound past the introduction.Won't get this one again.Item being reviewedThe Charles Dickens Collection, Vol. 2 (David Copperfield / The Pickwick Papers / The Old Curiosity Shop / Dombey and Son)The Charles Dickens Collection, Vol. 2 (David Copperfield / The Pickwick Papers / The Old Curiosity Shop / Dombey and Son)"
2,A very good TCP/IP book,"This book provides a very good study of TCP/IP in the context of Windows 2000. While the authors' style in on the dry side (How do you make this stuff exciting?); this is a VERY good book. The resource kit does have a book dealing with TCP, but its discussion is at a higher level - how is TCP/IP implemented in Windows 2000. The view there is from Windows to TCP/IP. This is a more general TCP/IP book with the emphasis from TCP/IP to Windows 2000. As a technical instructor and Windows NT and 2000 administrator, I refer to this book for low level disscusions of the protocol to clarify and explain the behavior of my systems."
1,don't let the cover fool you,"don't waste your time trust me it's not worth it alot of these were a ""watch once"" thing i think there was only four or five that were actualy any good so it's really not worth it"
1,Gross,"This stuff tastes awful. Maybe my expectations were off, but wow, this will ruin any and every coffee drink. I'd go with Hershey's syrup for a mocha before turning to this garbage any day."
2,This product is very comfortable,"I saw this product before, some years back when I owned a Colt 1991-A1, Compact Officers Model. The grips were able to tame down the recoil with there soft rubber & with the finger grips you've got complete control of the gun, so I bought them again! Using the same caliber (45 ACP.) on a larger full frame gun Sig-Sauer P-220, I wanted the same feeling. I'm happy to say that they work Very Well! Installing the grips were OK, they did require a little tweaking to align the screws to fasten to the frame. But, all in all nice grips!"
1,It doesn't spray but it still has suction,"I also bought this item to clean up pet messes - it's the 3rd portable cleaner that I've purchased (another Bissell and a Hoover). They all seem to work very well initially and then fall apart. This one still has suction but the sprayer no longer works. The ""dirty"" container has a ridge on the inside of the top and a very small opening which makes it difficult to completely empty and thus clean, not nice when cleaning urine and yuckier stuff. It can be difficult to get the containers seated properly and they sometimes spray out the top. And it is very loud. I just wonder if the designers of these products ever test them. It wouldn't take long for a pet owner to find the flaws."
2,Definitly the best murder mystery every written.,"What can I say? There is no other book that I've read (and let me tell you, I've read quite a few) that completely baffled me the way this one did. Not only is the real culprit a mastermind, but Christie is as well."
1,Spaniards invade Mystara,"A large part of this campaign's background constitutes what I consider to be one of the most unoriginal settings ever gotten to print. This setting seems to promote wholesale dumping of real- world history into a fictional setting. Not only is this extremely contrived, but it also is an insult to role-players' creativity in general. The ""setting"" is thinly disguised Central America of approximately sixteenth/seventeenth centuries, spiced with mutations. Pretty much everything is named in very generic Spanish (White Mountain, Blue House, Long River). Most of the campaign seems to emphasize recovery of treasure left by the long-gone Aztec-like culture. There is hardly any role-playing at all: virtually the entire campaign screams ""combat-oriented dungeon crawl"". The Legacies resulting from the ever-present ""Red Curse"" are somewhat interesting, but the setting hardly tangles with the implications of wide-spread mutations. A very poor job from TSR."
1,"Cute, but not well made","We are huge Razorback fans, so of course this was a must-have for our 12 month old son when riding in the car. Much to my disappointment, It lasted all of 5 days! Yes, my son did grab it a few times, but def not hard enough to break it or cause it to malfunction. It was just much more cheaply made than I expected it to be. But GO HOGS!!!!"
1,This sucks,"If you thought the original versions were bad, then these mixes will leave your mouthfeeling like hell. For good rap-metal listen to Rage Against the Machine, Body Count and E-Town Concrete, and for good music in general listen to Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Sepultura, Metallica (hell, even the new stuff's better than this crap!), Anthrax, Sevendust, etc."
2,LaVinia,I got the CD early and I was surprised because it plays like new. This is the first time that I ordered used CD and I'm happy because my collection of NOW CD's will almost complete. Keep up the excellent job and honesty!
2,Wind it up,"This product works very well. You have to make certain that there are no kinks in the electrical cord while you wind it. Keep shaking it out and wind it, then shake it out some more. It unwinds really easily."
1,Horrid Book - Pass it by,"I've been reading true crime books for over 20 years. There are a bunch of great books out there, and a bunch of horrid books out there. This one, by far, is the worst true crime book I've ever had the displeasure of reading.Furio's commentary is juvenile. The editing, if there was any, leaves much to be desired. And she leaves out the most crucial part of the book -- her own letters to the killers.This book is not a penetrating look into anything other than the bottom of your wallet.Oh and has anyone else noticed that nearly all of the good reviews are written by ""a reader"" and are all written in an identical manner? Appears to me that Furio is trying to toot her own horn to drum up more business for the waste of paper she calls a book."
2,Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000,The Logitech quickcam pro 9000 was easy to setup and performed very good. This is my first webcam and I am very happy with it. The picture quality is very good and the microphone works good. I bought 2 on the same day and sent one to my daughter at college. We can now talk and see each other which is very very nice since she is 2 states away. The other good thing is that it is free on skype. I have also asked my sister to get one so I can see her too when we talk.The only bad thing which isn't that bad is the picture sometimes jumps a little or hesitates a little.
2,French Version of Relic,"In case anyone was wondering what this book was, it is the English translation of the French Translation of 'Relic', not a new book or rare one."
2,Excellent product,"This is the only album we will buy. They look very nice & professional on the bookshelf. They present 4 x 6 pictures very nicely, and allow for comments on the side. They are also expandable with optional expansion kits. I would strongly recommend"
