2,Great CD,"My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing ""Who was that singing ?"""
2,Book Still Gets Five Stars but One for Frey,"When I read this book a year ago, I found some aspects either ridiculous or too vague, and I assumed he exaggerated but accepted that as artistic license. I felt sorry for the guy and admired his strength to recover. Now America feels duped. He was a frat boy! He goes around making the Oprah scene and further embellishing on the details in his speaking appearances, and it looks like his parents are in on the joke. Enabling parents... drug user.... hmmm I see a pattern here. If only he had presented it as fiction. I give it five stars because it's a damn entertaining book. But James Frey gets one star for integrity."
2,Entertaining...,"After reading some of the negative reviews, I feel I should add my two cents because I feel as if some of the readers are losing site of these books.As a former 8th grade English teacher who has read her fair share of teen fiction, I feel it's necessary to remind people that these are fantasy books, and they have been written for entertainment, about magical and/or mythical creatures! They are not non-fiction, literary fiction, or biographies. Rather, they are meant for pure enjoyment and for teens. Teens love melodramas and things that relate to their current world (ie. relationships, parent issues, romance, intrigue, etc). These books provide all of those things while being FUN to read!I have thoroughly enjoyed reading them. In just a week, I'm almost finished the series! They've been exciting, engaging, and as you move from novel to novel, the character development and growth is solid. I have and will continue to recommend them for FUN reading!"
1,Brakes easy,The plastic hindge at the top of the fold broke after about 3 months of use. The good sound quality is of no use if the item is broken!
2,Flamin',"I must say that I have only read 3 of Zane's writings (as a Zane newbie) and this is, indeed, my favorite. It's flamin' hot and the storyline is great. As I read the book I felt like I was there and could see it all happening so vividly. I read the book in, like, 3 days because I couldn't put it down. 100 pgs a day. Once you read this book you'll get hooked...well...once you read any of Zane's books you'll get hooked!!! I know I have."
2,BALLET BEAUTIFUL,Great product! Easy to learn; makes you strong. If you concentrate and keep working at it-you'll be able to be proud of yourself.
1,Couldn't get through it,"After the third description of the hero's cornflower blue doublet with gold bows and lace at the wrsits, and the puffy pink satin inlay on his stockings, I had to put the book down. I realize the author was trying to make Alex as different from Fox as she could, but the constant descriptions of his fussy, sissy-like clothing ruined the book for me. There's no way a man in pink stocking could be sexy to me."
2,No mess! I recommend it even for dogs grooming,"I've had this same model for 4 years without any problem and I love the vacuum feature. I bought another one for my brother 2 years ago and I just got another for clipping my dog's hair. My mini-schnauzer needs a haircut every 3 weeks, and now I'm saving the $40 of the groomer."
1,What is this?,"To be honest, I must say that this work was a VERY BIG dissapointment to me. Contrary to what some people have said about ""Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi,"" I believe that to be one of Enigma's best works. But this one just doesn't do it. The endless repetition of Orff's ""Oh Fortuna!"" from Carmina Burana seems SO out of place with the songs. And he just inserts it EVERYWHERE! If it made the music sound good then hey, go ahead. But it's just a cacophony and an incredibly annoying thing to hear. Never got through the whole disk in one sitting. Definetly NOT a recommendation!"
1,plenty of cusion but the leather is very hard,"I have Rockport for more than 10 years but this pair is different, the leather is very hard and it rubs so hard against my ankles they become red and sensitive. There is plenty of cusion at the bottom of the shoes though. Hope Rockport will improve its quality to what it had before and in the mean time, I am sticking with my old shoes."
1,"bad quality, break after two weeks","First it is very difficult to set it up and it is not stable. After two weeks, it breaks apart and no longer useable. Bad quality for this price. DO NOT BUY."
1,A Reader From Texas,"This book is and out-of-touch with reality. The author consistently uses he when referring to the executive level and she when referring to administrative assistants. She implies that women should be well-mannered and look nice at all times, while it is accepteble for men to be bossy and rude.I do not recommend this book."
2,Bag paid for itself on the very first trip!,"I bought this bag after going through reviews of various comparable cargo bags. We used it to drive from NJ to Richmond. The bag arrived two hours before we were to leave for the trip. Since there were 4 adults and 2 kids, I wanted an overhead carrier to load the bags. The only downside is the difficulty in loading the bag on to the roof once the bags are all packed. Once we loaded it and started, there was some initial flapping but it soon settled down and was quiet.Now for the waterproof quality of the bag. Once we entered DE, it rained for the rest of the trip. Most of the time it was the kind of rain that forced people to drive at 40-50 mph with their blinkers on. We reached Richmond after almost 3 hours in soaking rain, there was not a drop of water or even dampness inside the bag. A great buy and the reviews here are spot on! Would definitely recommend."
1,You gotta be kiddin me,"Given the fact that this is the only edition available with all the short stories I wanted, took a chance! No TOC to jump to the beginning of each story, just a lump of words, then the first story starts suddenly.Amazon should be ashamed to charge money for this. not even an icon, just the ugly ""no image available"""
1,broken,"This was a gift for my Grand daughter, opened the box and it was broken. Was able to repair it with the help of some glue, but I may suggest better packing. Apart from that, it's a nice high chair for the money."
1,sixties propaganda,"the writing in this book is good, and it's sad that ""Go Ask Alice""'s author is supressed to this day from claiming his work. it is a depiction of a teen gone down the wrong path on drugs. she's lonely, pressured, and unhappy, and then she's introduced to that evil LSD, and sucked down a vacuum into the drugs, which beat up and eventually killed her. but does this really read like a girl's diary? especially a girl who's in the throes of a drug addiction, and apparently still thinks it's a priority to keep a diary? and why is she still anonymous? there is no alice, this is not a diary, this is just old 70's anti-drug propaganda. (the title is a reference to a jefferson airplane song, for you pre-teen girls reading today. it's called ""white rabbit"")"
2,Tales of the Rat Fink,"The story of Ed ""Big Daddy"" Roth was quite interesting. To see how his creations came about with the Rat Fink, his car creations and the insite into his younger years.A must watch for all Ed Roth fans i believe they will find it quite interesting."
1,Its not worth to buy,"I ve been using this mouse for almost a week now! The first day i got the mouse, it looked pretty kool to me. Was very small handy and light weight, however the installation guide wasn't very helpful but i still managed to install it in less than 5 minutes. The bad thing started the next day when i realized the next morning that though the mouse was turned off it just comsumed up all the battries which were included in the package, i ve changed the battried though and those are working fine now for the 3rd day. Another bad thing about it is that it won't work well on all the surfaces. It requires some non-reflecting and rough surface for best results."
1,so so,"When I first got this I was at first kind of bummed out. It says it fits the iPod Nano. It doesn't fit my Nano, it only fits the older white gum stick shaped iPod, the shuffle. Maybe there's a version of the Nano thinner than mine..whatever.Luckily, I had a shuffle stashed away. So, one count against.Then I realized once the shuffle is inserted, the placement of the button is wrong. You have to insert the shuffle upside down so the ear bud cord comes out properly, which puts the button on the front of the armband in the wrong place.Count two against.Every tried to wrap a stretchy thing around your arm with one hand. Guess what, it takes two hands.Count three against.I will give the armband a point or two for being incredibly cheap.I use it for a run daily as it does stay on my arm. I wouldn't recommend it to you dear reader, or anyone else unless you simply want something cheap. It fills that bill."
2,Stick with OEM!,Stick with what works. Original products! Give your truck what it deserves to make it last like an AMERICAN made truck is made to last.
1,Should have been fun but missed by a mile,"I just reread Murder at Maddingly Grange after about ten years. I was as disappointed this time as I was the last. It's got all the earmarks of a Wodehouse frolic crossed with a country house murder, a la, I suppose, Christie, but they just don't deliver. The attempt to emulate Wodehouse's delivery is overdone, and I can't quite figure out what the point is. Without giving away the ending, I can say that nothing is as you expect it to be, but not, unfortunately, in a good way. Pity."
1,disappointing,"I was surprised when this product arrived looking like something I would have put together myself, in a 'tupperwear' type plastic box (not even the right size for the contents) and the items inside were sort of a 'throw together' hodge podge of things. It fulfilled the descriptions but some of the pieces were actually adult size (plastic gloves and face masks) and even the 'doctors coat' was just a disposable scrub, much too large for the average kid who would be young enough for this kind of play. I am still considering sending it back but my daughter (mother of the gift recipient) is insisting it's fine and her daughter is enjoying it. This may be a start-up/home business, which I applaud, but they need to step up the quality."
2,Stripper Clips,"20 for 5 dollars this is a steal! Got mine in the mail pretty fast, they were brand new and lighty oiled all but one works great. I definitely recommend this to anyone who owns an SKS."
2,Ultimate Comic for the Comic Freak,"This review is based on just by the looks of it. It Features the first 13 issue's, Leather like blue cover under the ""case cover"". The ""off-da-hook"" art work is that of it's orginal issue's even with free peaks of sketch's featuring some friend's and foe's :) A must have comic ""BOOK"" Nuff Said"
1,Lacking,"Aside from the fact that as soon as the warranty expired the CD player started jamming often, I was disappointed with it from the beginning. Although one can categorize each CD by genre one can't have the player play a random selection of a particular genre which makes the random function rather useless it's difficult to have a dinner party and have the CD player skip from Miles davis to Red Hot Chilli Peppers to Chopin. These days there are players with even larger capacities. One can do better..."
2,Balanced Nutrition,"I'm not a fan of 'fad' diets, and some might argue that South Beach falls into that category, but these South Beach bars are nothing but healthy, tasty, and serve as a great meal replacement option. The chocolate crisp bars are probably the best flavor, and are surprisingly enjoyable for the amount of nutrition packed into them. They're not like the cardboard flavored dense nastiness of many meal bars. Accompanied by a nice piece of fruit, they'll replenish you after a strenuous workout.Great tasting, solid nutrition, well worth it."
1,HP 970Cse prints SLOW,"We have an HP 970Cse for the last few years and have tried everything under the sun to get it to printer more clearly and faster, and nothing has worked, including this cartridge. We replaced the 970Cse with an Epson Stylus C84 and are 100% happier."
2,Not for iPod classic-- in spite of Belkin's website,"I bought one of these gizmos on the basis of Belkin's inclusion of this product in the list of those compatible with the new iPod classic.The recording and external-power functions work. Nothing else does. The button and LED don't work and it won't sync through the Mini USB connector.It shouldn't be difficult for Belkin to fix this problem, but for now, don't buy this item for use with an iPod classic.[...]"
1,Way bigger than I thought.,"I bought this for a stocking stuffer. Lo and behold, when it arrived it was nearly a foot tall! There are no measurements (except weight) in the products description. Since it was labeled as a toy, I assumed it to be at least as small as the drink it mimics. Now that I bought this for my mom, I'll never hear the end of it!"
2,Great for Cycling/Sport,"I wear these when I go cycling - the loop over the ear is a must for keeping the earbuds in the ear. The sound is great - but the other reviewer had a point about the buds needing to be in your ear to have good bass. This actually is a plus for me - jam them in when I am on the road alone (no cars) and move them so they are not ""jammed in"" when I need to hear the sounds of traffic around me.And for those that are cycling with these or any headsets, wear a helmet and use a read-view mirror. Know your surroundings and stay safe!"
2,Mens Stringer Tank Top by Pitbull,dig my new stringer Pitbull. These have gone out of fashion but for us old school bodybuilders these are the greatest style for lifting. nothing beats the full range of motion and that nearly shirtless feeling they give you in a public gym. I may have to order another one in another color I love this one thank you.
1,Should be titled 'A Brief Intro to MS Windows',"Good news: the book has great style, format and layout. Bad news: content. I waited until I passed my WinArch exams before I could objectively review this book. This book doesn't 'offer complete preparation for taking and passing MCSD exams 70-160 and 70-161' like the blurb on the book cover states. I complained to MS Press and MCP regarding this statement and a rep from MCP.com admitted (via email) that 'no one source of reference is sufficient to pass the exam'. Too bad MSPress didn't consult MCP (or that person) before designing the book cover. If you are new to programming then you will learn a lot about Windows by reading this book BUT you won't be able to pass the exams! I'm writing to MS Press to request a refund. I suggest everyone who has purchased this book do the same."
2,Forget About The Books It Is Based On! This Game Is Fun!,"Now I do not have to read the books to understand what Lord of the Rings is about. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" PC goes by the books very well (or so I have heard from many people). This game is very fun to play and is a good habit: I just can't stop playing it!"
1,I WAS DISAPPOINTED,"I am disappointed with this little cleaning stone, having read the reviews and weighed my decision to buy, considering the cost and expectations.The cleaning block dissolves quickly and you must use a LOT of elbow grease to try and achieve the anticipated results.I rubbed. Little change. I rubbed again. Sigh.I will not be purchasing again."
2,One of the greastest,"Cream would be one of the best classic rock bands ever. So much talent, amazing lyrics, amazing guitar and vocals what else could you want?...If you like Eric Clapton then heres some of his ealier works."
2,funny stuff,This was a great dvd. I hadn't seen this show in 50 years but it was still very funny. I got a great deal through Amazon.com
1,2012 and STILL not mac compatible,"Get with the program Omron...I can't believe it's 2012 and I STILL can't use my omron with my mac. I got this as part of a work promotion and I""ve had it for 2 years...unable to use it. What a useless product for about half of all computer users. Fitbit it is then..."
2,"Nice top, but consider the insert plate....","The top seems really nice. Well thought out, nice attachments and capabilities, but what happened with the router plates? I have had to purchase two different plates with different size openings to accomodate different size bits, and even then, it's often not an ideal sized opening. Where are the interchangeable insert rings? Who forgot about those? Supposedly, the new aluminum plate has inserts, however, I haven't actually seen one yet....Maybe when they materialize, this oversight will be history."
2,Good for sparking interest in Siberian magick,"Many have dis-liked this book, feeling that it is not valid, and a pure fictional account. This is not what I found, so much as it is an account of Siberian magick from the viewpoint of a first-timer. There are many assumtions made, and literary additions that seem unlikely, but at the core the methods described are the same as found in many reference books about Siberian magick - she may have even intended to compile information from other books into a narrative extraction for the sake of readability. I happen to find prose much more readable than the tombs of 'scholarly' reference books, and this book takes about one day to finish. All in all, a worthwhile glimpse into Siberian magick. Just dont use this as a reference for practicing it - let it spark the interest, and then get more accurate books if it was interesting."
2,All about veddy proper English tea,"This delightful volume captures the charm of the ceremony of afternoon tea, from the glamor of taking tea at the Ritz to the coziness of taking tea by the fire with the curtains drawn against the blustery day. Literary quotations, historical anecdotes, recipes for all the best delicacies served at tea, tips on tea-making, and lovely line-drawings make this book a must for tea-lovers and Anglophiles. It is a treasure to have."
1,Terrible,"This is absolutely the worst Latex paint I have ever used.It was like water in the can. Stirred and stirred and still didn't help much. The coverage was terrible.3 coats and still looks terrible. Yes, I primed the wood before I used this.Try 1 more coat and if it isn't any better,throw the project away and start over. I only use high quality brushes,which is what the can suggested.Will never buy this paint again!Some suggested that I got a bad can.I did not get it from Amazon,maybe that's the problem, always been happy with Amazon. I am not willing to take the gamble on this paint!"
1,Power Steamer,In reviewing the comments on how much you can do with this product I must say I am a little disappointed. I thought I could use it to steam clean my outdoor BBQ grill. It did not do anything to the outside. I even sprayed it first with a cleaner. I also tried to clean the grills. I had to spray Oven Cleaner on the grill first & had to use one of the brushes to get it somewhat clean. I have no intention to remove wallpaper but did use it to clean the ceramic tile flooring in the kitchen. Decent job.Too much money for the job it did.
2,Well that's just like your opinion... man.,"Here's my opinion.When it comes to movies with funny and memorable lines, you can do no better than The Big Lebowski and a little known Canadian movie called Fubar. If you like Coen Brother's movies, then you'll also enjoy this movie.Both movies have a lot in common, as they centre on non traditional protagonists. In the case of this movie, it tells the story of the pot smoking, white russian drinking character known as ""The Dude"", but I'm not going to go off and retell the story. Just watch this movie, and if you have the right sense of humour, you will enjoy the characters and jokes just as much as I do."
2,Updating the fireplace,Very nice for a very reasonable price. A bit lightweight but adequate for what we need. Looks much nicer next to the fireplace
1,Rainstorms & Nature,"This is most definitely the worst nature sounds CD that I've ever heard. The CD is mostly made up of various animal sounds such as a dog barking, horse neighing, etc...The tracks that are actual sounds of nature such as wind, rain etc... are very poor quality and range from around 23 seconds to just over 1 minute (there are 72 tracks on this CD). If you are looking for samples of sounds for a project, then this CD is for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time."
2,If Terry Gilliam made an album...,"this would be it. It's a bizarre(duh), surreal, and constantly changing set of songs(yes they are songs, they DO have structures, even if they're abnormal structures) that will either blow your mind or annoy the hell out of you. For me, it's a little of both. Sometimes I can put on this cd and love it. But im not ALWAYS in the mood to listen to and odd little number like ""Chemical Marriage"", or the noise-fests that are ""Everyone I Know From High School Is Dead"" and the latter half of ""Merry Go Bye Bye"". Still though, this can be a pretty impressive album, and any Bungle fan who doesn't yet own it definitely should."
1,IT SUCKED,"""SCREAM"" WAS ORIGINAL,SLICK,AND STYLISH. AND ,SADLY,""SCREAM 2"" IS WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED OF A FILM TRYING TO CASH IN ON THE ORIGINAL'S SUCESS, PITIFUL.""SCREAM 2"" IS PRETTY MUCH A REMAKE OF THE FIRST,EXCEPT YOU BRING A FEW NEW VICTIMS ,A NEW SETTING ,AND A POOR SCRIPT.AND,SADLY, THE SAME AUDIENCE THAT ATTENDED ""SCREAM"",RETURNED TO SEE THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR A HORROR FILM,THUS INEVITABLY,BRINGING ON A THIRD ""SCREAM"".I WOULD DISOWN THIS CRAP IF I MADE IT.BUT,TAKE YOUR CHANCE,I DID ,AND I GOT BURNED."
1,Too juvenile,"I found this to be ridiculously juvenile. I skipped the first ten or so chapters because it provided absolutely no information that any person over the age of ten should know. I did however find the chapters on stock and mutual funds, etc to be very helpful. Not for someone over the age of fourteen."
1,Interesting book but tedious and dated,"first the good: Ms Hamilton is very knowledgeable on the subject and provides a great deal of connection between the Classical Greek and modern thought. The book contains a great deal of food for thought.Now the bad. First, I don't really care for the writing style. This is however a fairly minor issue compared to a bigger issue: bad comparisons.You can't compare a good translation of Classical Greek (such as Pindar) in Modern English and say how contemporary something sounds. Of course it sounds contemporary, if the translator was any good... In fact, Pindar and Homer composed works which would be, on the whole, very different from what people write today. The focus on similarities, especially in translation, is quite misleading.On the whole, I think some people would get something out of this book, but I think there are far better works which address both similarities and differences."
2,Wimzie's House,"This Horace Bean Bag is VERY Nice! I have the Horace ""Plush"" and I just bought the ""Bean Bag""...it's about 1/3 the size of the plush toy. It's still a good size, durable, and looks good. I thought it was going to be very small, but it is actually about 7 1/2"" tall (approx). and it looks good! Definitely worth the price!!!"
1,Not Worth It,"Just because a movie is supposed to be scary, is visually stunning in a few brief moments doesn't mean it's good. Jennifer Lopez didn't help this movie either. When I Watched this movie I was not impressed, this movie is just a weird combination of other movies. It's ""Lawnmower man, Nightmare on Elm St, and Silence of the Lambs"" thrown in one big blender and set to mush. I didn't think one part of this movie was even remotely interesting or scary. Vince Vaughn acted Lethargic and D'Onfrio just wasn't scary. No good acting + bad overall story= NOT WORTH IT. Sorry but I just report the facts."
2,Return to form at last,"I disagree with other reviewers. Season 6 was Buffy's worst season with meandering story lines and unconvincing villians. An evil Willow was a step too far in my opinion. Season 5 had been a bit indifferent as well, the low point in Australia was when the Season 5 episodes were too slow (around the time of Joyce's death) that they screened Hush from Season 4.This season is very dark, like Season 5 and the siege-feeling pervades. But it has better storylines and a more convincing villain. It was good to see Buffy come back to form before it ended. The show really peaked in Season 3 and never quite recaptured the humour of seasons 1 and 2, but they certainly produced some good episodes in the later years."
2,This book helped me pass this test,I found this book very helpful in passing my MCSE Enterprise exam. Especially helpful was the section on how domains share information.
2,My dog hates to take pills,"This product works well for the dog who runs away whenever the daily pills show up. I lie and tell her that this is a chocolate ball and when she remembers it isn't, I tell her it is a liver ball and that gets her every time. I like this as much as the pouches now on the market. The product is worth the price, but care is necessary so that the pill is covered and doesn't become uncovered in the process. My dog is smart, though not all that smart, and needs to take several pills daily to keep from being in pain, to control her thyroid. Youth is in the mind of the beholder, and with aids like this even my 11 year od Old English Sheepdog behaves like a puppy."
1,Don't bother,"Purchased this and and it didn't work. Contacted Excalibur directly and they weren't surprised. They promptly refunded my money once I mailed proof of purchase over. Was so looking forward to this game, totally disappointed."
2,Grandma,"I purchased this set for my granddaughter who is getting ready to go off to college. She hasn't used it because she doesn't leave for two months. However, we are very pleased with how it looks now. It's an attractive set and the quality is good."
1,wish there were 0 stars,"This movie is horrible but worse is the attempts by desperate online salesmen to make the less bright of us grab this awful DVD up... Gore hounds take notice, the blood looks fake, anyone who thought this was snuff must be color blind, not worth the cost, if you have a cool indie rental place (Louisville KY is so lucky) check it out if you got plenty of friends and beer, otherwise don't bother... Japanese Evil Dead Trap was wayyyy better"
2,Excellent music at a great value!!,"I love this album. I noticed in was in a Christmas display last year and the person using the music said he saw this group with a big name artist at a concert. Very talented musicians, would buy more of their stuff."
1,bulky piece of tool,"I still haven't used it myself....the piece seems fine, but I wouldn't have bought it if it weren't on sale."
2,Blind Dogs,The book has brought some understanding of how to live with a blind dog. It has some great ideas that you would not think of. Our pet will be happier because of the read. The book was shipped fast and with no defects.
2,"Great music, but not a lot of it","First the good news: the music is wonderful. Great playing, and a terrific mix of standard jazz styles (There Ain't No Sweet Man, in particular) with Beiderbecke's chamber explorations. It's definitely worth many listenings.The not-so-good news. I didn't think it was technically possible to only put 43 minutes of music on a compact disk. Seriously, the album seems awfully short for the money."
1,Okay story; needed better acting and photography,"The story here is okay, but the acting, directing, and photography leave much to be desired. This was clearly made on a shoestring budget, but even at that, there should have been more quality control. If you want a better film about Native Americans, try Smoke Signals or Christmas in the Clouds."
2,Good first in series.. after that... downhill,"This is a good first in the series. Unfortunetly the series starts going downhill around the 6th book. Starts into the ""worship anita"" thing. She has sex with everything and the books are just very boring..... no story or plot at all.But this first one is great.."
2,First web DW book with serious technical detail,"This is the first book on data warehousing and the web that actually goes into detail about web-based data. Instead of the obligatory chapter about fields in a server log and ""what is a cookie"", this book has several chapters of detailed explanation about web server data and the kinds of problems in it. One of the most useful sections describes the all the steps in the building of clickstream ETL. It also has a complete set of clickstream data models, although we already designed ours by the time I read the book."
2,Fun Past Time,"This is my husband's spare time fun toy. He hasn't used it as much as he thought he would, but does amuse him when he does. A fun buy."
2,Life Changing,"When I first read the book it didn't make much of an impact - nice thoughts. But no real impact.Then for some reason I picked it up again about a month later - and a light went on. I don't want to give it away in a review, but this is a life changing experience! I've now read it at least 15 times and continue to read a chapter or two on a regular basis. Get this book and when you read it - do so slowly. Pray about it. Understand what it means to be blessed by God. Understand what it will do in your life.Yes. This book is not the Bible. But the Bible is inspired by God - which means there are no throwaways or accidents there. There are genuine truths within the Jabez prayer."
2,The Wolf of Her Dreams,"Wolfgang Hardwicke, the Earl of Northcliffe, has met his match with Grizelda Fleetwood. He sees the tall, well formed lady and sets his sights to seduce her to his bed. Being an opinionated, bluestocking woman, she doesn't surrender to the game. I liked these two characters who try to outwit the other in tactics. The chase is on, so to speak, to see who surrenders first. The author did a fine job on keeping the pace with clever innuendos and hot scenes."
2,"Simply the best, as always. Highest recommendation!","If you can only get 1 book about Bettas this should be it. Dr. Goldstein is an expert and although I do disagree with some of his thoughts on the need to keep Betta variety names to a strict scientific form, I realise his intentions are good as well as valid. His overview of the Betta world is most complete and the many less known ""wild"" betta species receive excellent coverage in his effort. I do wish it had more photos of the more recent varieties that have been developed such as the Crowntail and Halfmoon but the descriptions are very good and a web directory guides readers to sites which will fill in the gaps. Any of Dr. Goldsteins books are an excellent addition to the Betta or other tropical fish fanciers library. I've been keeping Bettas for more than 40 years now and Dr. Goldstein's books were there every step of the way. This book will most definitely enhance your pleasure in keeping these fascinating little fish!"
2,Van helsing [rocks!],"Everything about the movie was great! The movie is one of the best action movies you'll ever see! Jackman was great.David Wenham (the friar guy) was very funny! Van Helsing has so many weapons, he could give 007 a run for his money. Also, Van Helsing kills Draucla in a way you'd never expect. He gets killed when Van helsing... well I don't want to spoil the ending for you if you haven't seen it, so i'll end by saying that everything about the movie was great!"
1,What The Hell?,"This movie was pure redneck horror trash.....ok maybe I'm being a bit hard on this movie but Rob you really let me down on thise one....It really took you that long to make this crap???? and all that time for what, nothing original, I mean the movie borrowed from everything from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Natural Born Killer type cinematics.... pluse all those cheesy flash backs made for a realy ...annoying movie. I gave it one star cuz it was more cheesy and disgusting than even close to the scary horror movie I was expecting."
2,f.valdes,"it is good,subwoofer needs a little more punch.when doing the adjustment((hint) for highier sound quality put (the sound by-pass )in off position.Although front speakers sound good,they could had sound better if they were accoustically improved.I am almost an audiophile.In general I like this yamaha specially for music."
1,Unreliable,"I bought this flashlight for walking my dog in the evening and while I loved it the first few times now it constantly flickers, dims, and is more irritating than it is helpful. On the upside the size is perfect for long walks but does not serve it's purpose which is to help me see where I am going. Sadly I bought a 3-LED pup-light for my dog and that doesn't flicker and is 20 times brighter!"
1,Ill-fitting maternity swimsuit,"If you have a large chest, this swimsuit is not for you! I'm pettite and have a small frame, but my chest is large, especially with being 6 months pregnant. In the picture, this tankini looked like it would be roomy up top. The cups are extremely small and inside the top, there are these little pads which I'm assuming are to hide your nipples. Well, you can see the outline of them once you have the top on. I would not recommend this tankini to anyone who has a cup size of C or more. When I went to return the swimsuit, I found out that Belly Basics does not accept returns on sale items, hoisery, or swimwear. I was not aware of this return policy when I ordered the suit, and I can't find anywhere on the web page where this policy is stated. I contacted Belly Basics through email, however, and they did allow me to return the suit."
1,no rise,"I tried one of the recipes in the enclosed cookbook, as well as muffin mix from the supermarket. I used self-rising flour as instructed. In both cases, the muffins would not rise.I was very disappointed."
2,I thought this book was great.,"I totally felt like I was a part of this book when I was reading it. At times, it could have gone a little faster, but it was altogether a well-written book. The way the author wrote the book made you understand exactly how the characters looked and felt at the various parts of the book.What's good about it is that it's pretty fast-paced."
1,Neil Young's worst album of all time!!!!!!!!!,"I had the unfortunate experience of hearing this album again last week which reminded me why I traded in this piece of garbage years ago in college. This is hands down ""THE WORST NEIL ALBUM EVER""!Electric drum kit? Please. At least it fits the trend of the '80s....his worst album would be released during the worst music decade. Do yourself a favor and save your ears...don't buy or even listen to this album unless you need a laxative."
2,Great Desk Decoration,"The cockpit opens, everyone wants to open it up.It looks just like the pictures show, keeps me smiling through the day.."
1,dont use on anything thicker that tinfoil,I paid 15 dollars and waited 2 days for this bit so i could finish a project. i had to drill 3 holes in 1/8 inch angle iron. it didn't even make it through one hole before it dulled and became useless. it says metal/wood/plastic on the package but i don't know what metal it is referring to unless its tinfoil. i got dewalt because of the name but what a disappointment.
1,Professional Trim Carpenter,I have been a full-time finish carpenter for the last seven year's. I was hopeful that I would pick up some useful tidbit from the book. I learned absolutely nothing new. I guess this was a novice book.
1,DOESN'T WORK ON ORDINARY BOOTS,COULD BE THIS IS FOR COWBOY BOOTS ONLY WHICH I DON'T HAVE. WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT AS DOESN'T WORK ON BARBOUR RUBBER BOOTS ETC. WHAT DOES WORK IS OLD FASHIONED PLASTIC BAGGIES IN BOOTS!!! MAYBE RUN WITH THAT CONCEPT AND DESIGN LONG LASTING PLASTIC BAGGIE TYPE LINERS AND YOU'LL HAVE A WINNER. Meryl
1,"Good product, price is high","The tape itself is fine, but at over $6, I would expect more total material. In fact, I was able to find this same 3-pack in stores for 1/2 the price."
1,This isn't Dead Can Dance,"I don't plan to wax poetic on Lisa Gerrard's exquisite voice, considering how other reviewers have quite beat me to it; I will say that the music is indeed slower, almost monotonic compared to the work Lisa did with Brendan Perry in Dead Can Dance. Her voice is what redeems this album. She sings with power, and has not really chosen music that matches that power. Some tracks do indeed live up to her potential, but many do not. One suspects that she and Perry drove each other to work harder and produce far better music than either might have done alone. But if this is your first exposure to Lisa Gerrard, check out any and all of the music she did with Brendan Perry. You will certainly hear her qumys-strong voice but to excellent use."
1,Not one of his best!!!!,"The Broker is based on a good story but right from the start,it resembles other Grisham thrillers while lacking the tempo,the brilliance ....All through the book I had the unfortunate feeling that it was written too fast,and not edited with care.Some parts are downright boring,time for John Grisham to ponder seriously on his writing.I expected much more from him!!!"
2,SHAKESPEARE'S CHRISTMAS,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK ONLINE BECAUSE I COULD NOT FIND IT LOCALLY. IT IS IN VERY GOOD SHAPE. I LOVE THIS AUTHOR. SHE WRITES A VERY GOOD BOOK.
1,"Tedious, cliche-ridden story by an author out of her depth.","The more I read by Anne Perry, the more I realize what a mediocre writer she truly is.I am somewhat of a WW1 buff, so I thought I'd try this book to see what Perry could do with a different time period.From the first chapter, she simply rolls out one plot cliche after another, with overwrought dialog and characters from central casting. The central mystery isn't even that compelling, and there are mysterious characters whose significance is never explained. I realize now that the reason for THAT ploy was to drag out this thin plot into an entire series, which is the literary equivalent of watering down the soup.I will not be returning to this series. If you're looking for some quirky mysteries set in the same general era, try the Charles Todd series about Ian Rutledge. Or read some books that were actually written at the time, rather than Anne Perry's amateurish re-creations."
1,Big mistake!,"I was excited about this pump based on a presentation during my childbirth/breastfeeding class. I fell in love with it in the first few weeks of using it because its as comfortable as other reviewers said. Sadly, after using it for two months (2 times a week when I went to work) the motor gave out! Playtex replaced the motor at no charge only for it to burn out again in three months. After my one year warranty runs out in June, I'll most likely have to buy another pump. Stick with what's tried and true...Go Medela."
1,"Same old, same old","What a disappointment. As an experienced teacher, I should've been more careful. There are NO examples, no new stories, nothing original or new. The same graphic organizers we have all seen. Save your money and buy something else. From now on, I think I will preview at the bookstore before I purchase through internet."
1,this is just a load of krap..,what is this???what the hell is metallica trying to do??its like..they WANT to SUCK and purposly get rid of their fans with this piece of krap record..dont buy this..metallica is dead..this isnt metallica..its sh*tIlicka
2,This was a very good book.,This was the first of Sue Civil Brown's that I have read. It made me want to read her other books. I hope Sue Civil Brown will keep on writing as I want to keep on reading her books.
2,"Inconsistent, but still one of my favorites","Season 1 of Leverage was pretty solid through and through, Season 2 began what I feel to be a hit-and miss trend, and Season 3 continues what Season 2 started, both good and bad.Now, I love the show - even the episodes that I feel are not very strong are still fun and overall entertaining. The episodes that ARE strong may be the strongest of the series, but unfortunately are not as plentiful as in previous seasons. Missing more than other seasons is the slick ""flow"" that reminded me, in prior episodes, of a 42 minute Ocean's movie each week.It's still well written, funny, high-tech and worth watching - it just feels like its slipped a bit from its previously high elevation."
2,Good all around binocs,Excellent value in these all around binoculars. Easy to focus and you'll appreciate that they are armored when you drop them. Virtually indestructable. A frequent travel companion that stowes easily.
2,Great alert,"I received the alert system 6 days after ordering it. One day I was heading out the door with my kids on a nice, partly cloudy day when we heard a loud alert coming from a room on the other side of the house. I hadn't heard the alarm before, so we went to check it out. The radio alarm is loud, so it would definitely wake you in an emergency. The weather channel was alerting us that we were in a tornado warning. I got the kids and we went to the basement. About 3-5 minutes later the tornado sirens started going off outside. The alert system gave us several extra minutes before the outside alarms went off. A tornado did not come through our direct area, but it was nice to know when to head to safety. You can set the alarm to sound for many different watches and warnings and for different county areas. With all the extra storms this year, I thought that this could be handy and it already proved it works great."
1,Horrible,"The images are cheap and cartoony - you can get better clip art on Microsoft Word. So lame is this product, that there was nothing suitable to make decent Christmas cards. I'll try Hallmark - maybe they'll have classier stuff."
1,A Real Disappointment,"As far as I'm aware this album did not go on general release in Europe, so when I found it as a US import I jumped at the chance to buy it, as Between The 1 And The 9 is one of my top three albums of all time (one of those which you can listen to over and over and over and over and never grow tired of...).Although music critics generally seem enthusiastic about Rothberg's new album, suggesting that she shows a more mature approach, I have to say I was really disappointed. It might well be more complex, but the sound was rough and harsh, while the lyrics were almost indistinguishable - and those that weren't, were distinctly uninspiring.I'm sure this album will win her a lot of new fans, but I advise old fans who buy Candelebra Cadabra that this album takes you on a completely different trip - and not one that I personally enjoyed.A real let down after Between The 1 And The 9."
2,Inexpensive and worked well for Halloween,"Bought these for trick-or-treating around the neighborhood (and the kids love them). They were nice colors, bright, and lasted several hours, as advertised. I only wish they came with a lanyard or clip."
2,BEST OF THE NEW SCOOBY-DO MOVIES,"I ENJOY THE SCOOBY-DOO MOVIES. WHERE ARE THE OTHER NINE. THE ADAMS FAMILY, JEANNIE AND BABU, PHYLLIS DILLER, JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS, SONNY AND CHER, JERRY REED, DAVY JONES, SANDY DUNCAN, TIM CONWAY, THE BEST OF THE NEW SCOOBY-DOO MOVIES WAS RELEASED MARCH 22, 2005 WHERE ARE THE OTHER NINE. PLEASE RELEASE THEM. I HAVE SEEN ALL 25 BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE ONLY SEEN WHAT IS IN THIS COLLECTION. IT'S TIME PLEASE RELEASE THE REST. IT'S BEEN OVER THREE YEARS."
1,Don't buy this colorful piece of junk!,"My son got this for his eighth birthday. First of all, it is not a ""Robot"" by any stretch of the imagination - you can only make it go forwards and backwards - and that very slowly. You have no control over the ""moveable"" arms or head and you can not make it turn or do anything really. Several of the things you build according to the instructions don't do anything except sit there and blink - not all that exciting. It took adult strength to get many of the poorly fitting pieces together. On the larger constructions the gears mesh so badly that most of your limited battery power is sucked up trying to turn them all - and the strain inevitably causes the poorly fitting wheels to fall off. Did anybody bother to ""kid test"" this thing before it wound up at all the ""educational toy"" outlets? I'm guessing not. Well, here is the lesson we learned - even a so-called ""educational toy"" can be a complete rip-off."
2,Worked well,The bottles worked well. We took two on the plane and had no issue with TSA. And we took 4 bottle on the curse sip with out them ever knowing. Make sure to put water in the unit to find any leaks. One of the six bottle had a leak and it was replaced by the seller with a few days. Drink up my friends.
1,Dead after three years,"I bought a Timex Expedition about three years ago. The buttons no longer work, the watch runs about five minutes slow, and the dial has corroded and leaves sores where it scratches against my arm. I paid nearly $200 for this thing, and I only wear it to the office, so it is very bizarre that it is in such horrible shape. I bought it here in France, but the store only gives a one-year warranty and it doesn't do repair work. I have a 30-year-old Seiko that still keeps perfect time, and I've got this three-year-old Timex that I might as well throw away. That's pretty bad."
2,Great product and great retailer,The game was shipped quickly and was exactly what I had ordered. I would recommend this retailer and shop again in the future.
1,Where Has Mr. Irving Gone?,The best character in this book for me was Mr.RamseyJACK BURNS! Every one else was holding someones penis for800 pages.
2,Wonderful book,"I got this book as a used, library book from amazon and I was not familiar with Mr. Dunnes writings but love his show on court tv. I usually only read autobios and bios, so I was somewhat unsure of the read but the author has a wonderful style of writing and imagery. I really enjoyed this book of three novels."
1,Disappointed in this Loyola Classic,"So many people told me how much they loved these books and I usually enjoy the Loyola Classics the book is a part of. But I found the characters flat, the dialogue wooden and the plot plain dull. I got half way through and decided that was enough."
2,its diffrent in a good way,ok so its nothing special but it is worth a look and for the price its worth buying.it has every thing a good movie should have a goode looking cast good acting and a great story line however the movie could have been much better.its about a ypung man is is very well of and how he disrespects people because of his wealth.but after his mother takes ill the tables are turned and now he is the poor one who has to find a job and support him self with no help from his former ftriends or family. it also a sorth of c0oming of age and the changing of the world the story is set in the early 1900 s
1,Interesting Critique of Fundamentalism,"It's rare to read a critique of fundamentalism from someone who actually understands its origins. Bawer understands it well, from Scofield to Lindsey to Robertson."
2,Musically their best album,"TMBG has many albums with more creative songs lyrically, but IMHO this is musically their best album. The end of the tour is awesome, as is subliminal. Some think No One Knows My Plan is the best song on here, but I disagree."
2,Review of Orlando Bloom book,This book was delivered to me in a timely fashion and was in perfect condition.
1,Quantity?? How many??,You see all of those manicure sticks?? How many do you think you will get? A pack of them? It doesn't say. I will let you in on the secret...you get four (4). Four sticks wrapped in bubble wrap and put into a small envelope.
1,Kind of flimsy,Pros: very cheapCons: very short cordJoystick wore out after a few weeks of heavy useI'd recommend paying the extra few bucks for a name-brand controller that will last longer
2,Rented it and I liked it so much I bought it,"I originally received the HD-DVD from Netflix and was impressed by the overall quality of this release. Heart was uber-huge back in the day, but they feel comfortable and confident as they play smaller audiences--quality over quantity. Ann still has that incredible voice, my wife, who was not particularly familiar with the band, was won over by Nancy's passion and spirit."
2,Not Mainstreem Ska - But they Rock!,"Hot Stove Jimmy deserves a great review. They are a really excellent ska band! If you enjoy the Blue Meanies, you will enjoy Hot Stove Jimmy. If you only like what MTV tells you to like, try Oasis - they seem to be trying like heck to get that guy noticed again."
1,dark shadows sucks more than just blood,I found myself chuckling just once throughout the whole movie.The plot was weak and the dialogue mediocre to put it gently.Would not recommend this movie even to my worst enemy
2,Gotta Love The Uncle Dave Macon,"My wife and I had been eyeing this boxset for a few years now and she finally broke down and got it for me this past holiday season. It's a nice mix of country, blues, gospel, cajun/zydeco, tejano and native American. Overall, the box set is excellent. I don't think there is a bad tune on there, but I do feel it felt short on gospel, folk, cajun, zydeco, tejano and native American styles. There's only about 6 or 7 tracks for each of those styles where an entire 16-19 track disc is dedicated to both country and blues. The set should have been 6 discs instead or it should have been limited to just country and blues. Likewise, I felt it strange that an American Roots boxset included no jazz, for jazz is the only true first American born music, which is based on the blues of course. It's a great collection though and I enjoy listening to it every time. The long wait was worth it. I highly recommend it."
1,Very small bowls,"I returned this item because they were very small bowls. I thought that they are different in size and bigger, but the once that I received were very very small and were not what I was looking for."
1,Died in 8 months Smartdisk difficult to deal with,"The drive was great but only lasted for 8 months when it crashed, and I lost all of my data. SmartDisk was not helpful at all and actually rude when trying to resolve this issue - I finally gave up and will never buy a SmartDisk product again! CAUTION ADVISED!!!JoAnn"
1,sands of time,Just not my cup of tea. I prefer the old standards. Thank you for following up with me and bringing it to my attention.
2,Perfect for Microsoft Flight Sim.,What more can I say. If you like Microsoft's flight sims then get this. It really makes all the difference in the experience. Granted you can use it for other flight sims too but for me this is why I use it. I love it to bits. Great joystick!
1,Not terrible,"This set provides a large variety, but does not hold up well at all. Both the tri-wing and t6 bits have been stripped and are useless now after only a few jobs. If you want something that lasts, dont get this. If you need variety for only a handful of jobs, this may be good for you.Dont expect it to be able to handle older tight screws. That is how my bits were stripped."
1,the chocolate was old,"the chocolate which is my favorite came to me white, like when chocolate is old. They were not fresh at all. I was very disappointed"
2,Excellent Debut from Down Under!,"Claire Trentain's music show the promise of Australia's next pop princess. I couldn't help but wonder if she were not perhaps the musical love child of Kylie [Minogue] and Keith [Urban]! There's a diversity among her tracks that show she can easily swing from dance to country and from soulful ballad to upbeat pop. Pretty and perky, this Aussie girl looks poised to follow up with even more sophisticated and enduring material in future CDs."
1,Eventual waste of money,"This printer started out alright, but then the software started getting buggy and I had to keep re-installing the software. I also could not use a preferred software to edit my photos and then print using this printer -it would not read my cropped files. I wasted so much money on ink and photo card paper trying to get it right. I could have bought a much more expensive and reliable printer. Lastly, HP seems to have spent most of its development money on writing their software to direct you to their store to spend your money on supplies. They totally forgot about the main purpose of the product - customer ease in printing. I will never buy another HP product again. HP did it to themselves. I can't wait to throw this one, literally, out the window."
1,Save your money!,"Anyone who has listened to Ronn's show for any amount of time can save their money on his book. He just repeats the same old observations and philosophies that he talks about on his show every week. Nothing,at all, new here. Ronn should stop writing books and start reading a few; he is the least prepared talk-show host in the Bay-Area. He praises the Drudge Report, Fox News, and Rush Limbaugh but has nothing but distain and ridicule for people on the left. Especially if they were against the rush to war."
1,Piece of Junk!!!,"The pressure washer gave out a burnt smell and quit working after only 20 minutes of operation, even after I followed the procedures exactly as the manual stated. I received no response from the manufacturer after trying to contact them. Save your money and buy from another manufacturer. I have to give it at least one star, because there's no option for no stars. A real piece of junk!!!"
1,one of the worst non-movies,"If you think the book is bad, the movie is worse. You are better off watching the trailers because then you at least get to miss the fluff and filler shoved in to make it a longer movie. Kind of like you can just read the first and last pages of the books, you probably get a better story."
1,Waste of money - sorry cuisinart :(,"Word of advice - NEVER NEVER get rid of your old faithful coffee machine until you've really tested out the new one......This model sadly just does not measure up the price and aesthetic look of the machine - The grinder is so loud it's like a wake up alarm for the whole house - the grinder is not easy to clean - for a thermal pot the coffee doesnt stay THAT warm., and when you do pour the coffee its painstakingly slow and no matter how careful you are it makes a mess everywhere....shame as cuisinart are normally very good - if you dont mind grinding your coffee at the supermarket then do that and stick with the previous cuisinart model."
1,"Essentials for design: Macromedia Flash MX 2004, Level One",Don't buy this book. It is full of errors and omissions.
1,Starret really likes their product,"As a woodworker and jointer I think the allure of the Starret brand is tempting. Practically speaking they are over priced. Claiming precision that is way beyond the accuracy of even the best woodworkers and the best chisels, saws, planes etc. does little to improve the quality of the product even when the claims are true. I'll stick with my $6 dollar, probably also more accurate than I can cut or measure, Chinese square and save my money for a better saw, chisel or plane where it does make a difference."
1,Not up to the usual high standard,"I have used Rick Steves' books for prior trips to Spain and France, and found them incredibly helpful and informative. This one, however, was slim on information. One example is the scarcity of restaurant recommendations in Amsterdam. This one missed the mark."
2,This is a great book,"This is an excellent introduction to Orthodox Christianity, especially as a comparison to Protestantism, and offers insight into why people are attracted to it (Orthodoxy). Someone said it could stand to have a few more footnotes, which I agree with. Yet, for his intended audience (Protestants), Matthew Gallatin does a great job of telling his own story of journeying toward Orthodoxy, and dispelling common misconceptions."
2,About time,"I have been waiting for this to be released. Finally after almost if not a year it has been released. As for the movie, I am reminded of Sydney White. The whole sorority setting were the girl takes on the Alpha sorority where they were suppose to be legacies but ended up not pledging and pledging elsewhere and/or not pledging. It is a lifetime movie,it is fun and upbeat. Lucy Hale did a good job in this... Not really much else to say on the movie."
1,What a waste,"Complete waste of $12.00. If they stayed in your ear they might be worth something, but good luck with that. In-ear earbuds work so much better than these."
1,One of the two already NOT working on day one,"disappointed that on the first day, with limited usage that one of these are not working. The flashlight works so I know the batteries and connection are good.Will return. Hopefully for a new one."
2,confusing for corgi,"Well - this is a darling toy...my corgi, however, is not that thrilled with it....he doesn't get the concept of taking the chipmunk-cross-squirrel out of the stump. He just shoves his nose in the middle hole to retrieve the cookie.Corgi gives it a 2 star rating, I give it a 2 -more star rating because it is a clever looking toy!"
2,This book was soo great!!!,This was the best book I ever read! I never cried so much from a book since I read Mick Hart Was Here. You absolutly *have* to read it! I wonder if there'll be a sequel?
2,it is great,this is one of the best books I've read in a while. I might even compare david fariland to JRR tolkien
2,Dated concept helped by solid music and lyrics,"Radio K.A.O.S.'s basic storyline deals with a young man who is believed to be catatonic, but actually has the ability to communicate through wireless devices. A truly 80's creation, this CD deals with a fascination for the early forms of today's commonplace technology, and surrounds itself with the fear of nuclear annihilation. The saving grace, for this outdated theme, is that Waters creates some of his most accessable songs for this CD. While not his most challenging work with its simplistic theme, Waters' songs are lyrically strong and the music serves these lyrics well. A good introduction to Waters' solo work."
1,no luck,"tried this with a mouse-- ps2 to usb.. windows 7 could not figure what driver to use..did not work.tried with a keyboard-- ps2 to usb.. windows xp did not find the device either.it may be possible to manually configure, has anyone got this adapter to work?ps2 devices probably do not give off the signature needed for windows to configure it."
2,A wonderful approach,This book filled all my expectations. I'm working in the advertising field and it gave me many lights about the way the people can be funneled into strange behaviors. The language is easy and the examples very well selected. It's funny (and scary) to realize how easy can our acts be directed by other people. It's a gem.
1,Not her best,"Sandra Brown is my favorite suspense/romance writer. I always look forward to reading her new releases and this book was no exception. However, I was very disappointed with Ricochet. Normally, her books have so many twists and turns that you can't figure out ""who did it"" until the very end, which keeps you up all night wanting to read. This book was different. I kept thinking it would get better but it never did. I highly recommend Chill Factor or White Hot instead of Ricochet."
2,THe Curious Wine - 1960's NC Homemake Women of Year Must Decide Between Family and Family?,Interesting look at the happenings in one women's life in 1960's North Carolina. Sort of an nearly-incentuous Bridges of Madison county. (don't have an affair with your husband's brother!) The 60's in the south was a turbulent place. Main character is pro-integration while most of the other characters are not. This is not a major theme but does occur and the objectionable word is present.Personally I don't think the brother is ever going to leave his wife for the main character.
1,"If Heloise or Emily Post tried to write a mystery, this would be it!","This book was ungodly boring. Nothing happened. Certianly nothing that warrented 223 pages to discuss. I found the tone of the novel to be similar to reading an Emily Post or Heloise column in the newspaper. Stuffy, old-fashioned, pompus, self-important and rediculous. However, I do believe that this book could be turned into an episode of a not so funny sitcom, as it seemed to have all the plot of an episode of Seinfeld without the humor. If you could imagine Northern Exposure without such an intresting plot, this would fit ""The cat who..."" sitcom exactly. Unfortunatly, this will be my first and last of ""The Cat who"" series as I cannot bear to suffer through another page of her useless, plotless, pointless drivel."
1,Not for beginners,"I liked the high speed but it is definately not for beginners. There is virtually no instruction on how to do moves correctly, and you could end up hurting yourself if you haven't been taught the correct way previously.Also, I felt very rushed and there's very little warm up. You kind of have to do something else before starting.Yoga Zone is much better."
2,Kate Bush's most beautiful album,"I gave this album 5 stars because (1) It blew me away the first time I listened to it, (2) it has tremebdous staying power: it is probably my most-played album in the last 10 years. It is full of wonderful medleys, sounds and layers of music that blend together. The Trio Bulgarka is used to wonderful effect in 'Deeper Understanding', 'Never Be Mine' and 'Rockets Tail', creating beautiful dissonance. Also there is wonderful use of special effects in a non-obvious way (vs. obvious sometimes overblown effects on other albums). Nine years later I feel what I felt when I first bought the album: this is Kate Bush's best."
2,Guided Life Review for Older Adults,I was very pleased with this purchase for the guided life review that I conducted as my Gerontology internship with a group of seniors. The book was very helpful.
1,disrespectful,"this alternative mickey mouse squeeking rapper immensely exagerates fictious tales of murder and rape, meanwhile claims to be the white representation of hip hop, the truest, most profound expression of feelings we posses.peace,2"
1,"Blu-rey ""Sherlock Holmes""","Unfortunately, my DVD seemed like a pirated copy of the film I thought I was purchasing. It not only randomly would glitch and go back to certain points in the movie over and over again, but I had no access to the menu items like the extras or the chapters.I went back online to Walmart and purchased a real copy"
2,One for all !!!,"Buy this book and you will know all you need to know about pet bird. You will find your suitable bird and how to make it healthy, happy. This book also teach you how to tame and train your intelligent bird. I love this book very much but if you want to know bird breeding in detail and enjoy beautiful photo, you may disappointed. Lack of color photo make me reduce 1 star when I rated but if you don't care, this book is a good choice for you. In my view, it is best to read if you are beginner in pet bird."
2,this is a must have,this is one that even if you've never heard them this is the cd to have..it has it all expect the song i wish it would rain..but this one a keeper......
2,so much fun for her and so cute to watch for me.,My 8 month old LOVES this toy. she would shake her rattle and watch him dance. sometimes pooh would make her squeal with joy. it's really cute to watch her play with this toy. i highly recommend this toy.
2,Great Binos but...,"I just got these from Amazon yesterday and have been having a lot of fun with them at night watching the stars. The image is sharp and I like the thumb rests on the bottom of each barrel. Quality is excellent except for one thing that nobody has mentioned in the reviews yet-that the support that holds each eyepiece to the body is made of plastic. You can gently push on each eyepiece and the plastic will flex, moving the eyepiece closer to the body. The flexing doesn't seem to cause any problems with the image but it bugs me. Everything else about them is excellent. They feel heavy duty and durable. I just wonder if anyone has broken the plastic piece or if it has caused the image to blur a little over time. Since Nikon has the 25 year warranty on them I have to have confidence that they will last. I'm taking away one star for the use of plastic in a key location that I think should have been made of metal."
2,Purists beware!,"Dashboard purists will likely be disgusted with this album. After all, almost the entire album is, **gasp**, recorded with a full band! As we all know, the only real Dashboard Confessional songs have only an acoustic guitar and vocals. When the Summer's Kiss EP was released it was criticized by the hardcore fans because it was recorded with a full band. Having said that, this is a great album! If you are willing to abandon your rigid adherence to traditional Dashboard and expand your horizons a little bit, give it a listen. Yes, it is a departure from the Dashboard of the past, but a good album is a good album."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,This grinding attachment leaves grease and metal in the meat. I am returning for refund. No excuse for trash like this to be sold in America. May be OK for third world use.
1,This book will do little to advance beginners,"This is an over priced pamplet that will do little to ""teach"" someone to begin to pitch. I have been involved in ASA softball for 8 years and, my daughter has been pitching for 2 years now. I bought this book to try to teach her different pitches. The book lacks a glossery to define some of her terms. In addition sequential drawings or photos would be very helpful to show what is trying to be explained. The book frequently references you to other chapters to try to explain what the current chapter is trying to explain. (example when attempting to understand what is being explained in ""The Change Up"" the sub heading ""Feet"" says ""you should have the same feet positions as in other pitches"" Say what????, which other pitches, why not type another two or three lines to explain it in this chapter. This happens repeatedly throughout this book (Pamplet)Save your money and invest in a trainer."
1,Stopped working after the first day!,"I bought two of these fish as a special treat for my son, who had been begging for them. I read the directions carefully, making sure the battery compartment was sealed when I screwed it on. Both fish worked great for the first day, but wouldn't work again after. I put new batteries in and they still wouldn't work. It seems as though water got into the compartment, which is poorly designed and not leak-proof.So, I returned both fish to the store and bought the ""Finding Nemo: Disney Swimming Dory"" and ""Finding Nemo: Disney Swimming Nemo"" instead. I recommend them highly; the battery compartment is sealed and well-designed, the fish are very cute, and they swim even faster than the Rainbow Reef fish! A real hit at the pool!"
1,"Boring ""comedy"", and an ugly actress.","One of the most boring ""comedies"" I have ever seen. The subject is the cultural differences, and that's it. It has some minor parts that can be funny, but it does not make it. It's a romantic comedy, that ends with the marriage of the american and the greek girl (that is really ugly) and he quits to his cultural formation for her. Yeah, I know, It's another one of those movies. It has had way to much publicity, and that has make it famous, but overall deserves a big D-."
1,"Great book, wrong Cover","This is a great book (5 star content), however, the kindle edition does not have the new redesigned cover (reason for 1 star rating). I really hope this gets fixed soon. The new covers are the only reason I am purchasing these books on the kindle. All the other WOT books I have purchased for the Kindle have the nice redesigned cover. If you want to know what the cover should look like (from the Tor Website): [...]"
1,Very dissapointed mommy 2 be,I was extremely dissapointed with this cover. I bought 2 of the quilted velour version and made the rookie mistake of washing them (even in cold water) before checking to make sure it fit with the contoured changing pad. It is much too small and looks terrible! Don't make the same mistake & buy this cover for that pad. Luckily we got one of the Wendy Bellisimo ones also which were (...)more expensive but fit perfectly!
2,Great Album,"Being a professional musician I listened closely to all of the songs on this CD and I personally think this is one of the best country CD's I've heard in years. I hope the record company will support these guys. I think all of the songs are very well written. Better than most of the junk coming out of Nashville now. The three part harmony is second to none. Reminds me of Restless Heart, Eagles etc. The music is so good, mixing, steel, banjo, guitar, and mandolin at just the right levels. One of the best mixes I've heard in along time. Buy this CD and turn it up loud. It's great."
1,Canon i80 Printer,"The i80 printer shipped quickly and I love the size and efficient way it prints. However, after using it for a short period of time the printer is not performing as well as I thought it would. When I replaced the ink cartridges the color was faded and when doing a cleaning I still have the same problem. Sheet feeding seems to be an issue at this point also. I'm using it as a second printer because of these problems. You get what you pay for."
2,Illuminating look behind the scenes,"To anyone interested in the inner workings of highly intense election campaigns, the press, or George W. Bush, then I highly recommend you take a look-see at this book. Frank Bruni, a fair and intelligent writer of the New York Times(a paradox of sorts), recounts his insightful, sometimes bizarre, ecnounters while being assigned to cover the Bush campaign for the duration of the 2000 campaign.Bruni makes this book worth reading alone for the many humorous and revealing anecdotes that unveil the lighthearted candor of George W. Bush and his entertaining give-and-take with the press while traveling aboard his campaign plane.When speaking of Al Gore, Bruni writes, ""He(Bush) made it clear that he saw Gore as equal parts pompous blowhard and preening chameleon, a spineless panderer ready to be anything for anyone. For Bush, this was distilled in a single, oddly chosen detail: 'The man dyes his hair.'"" Nuff said."
2,The Crue,"""Dr Feelgood"" and ""Shout at the Devil"" are the top two Motley Crue albums. (Depending on my mood, which is first and which is second.)'Nuff said."
1,unoriginal and uninspired,"nothing new here...if you like 'pieces', listen to coldplay's 'the scientist' which it is ripped off of"
2,Krait is Great!,"I bought BOTH the Krait and the Deathadder and have used both for several weeks. I like the Krait better because it is lighter, smaller, easier to use with your fingertips (instead of resting your whole hand as on the Deathadder), and the mouse buttons are quicker and easier to click. Krait is a bit of a narrow mouse but is easy to adapt to. Some may like the ""full-bodied"" feel of the Deathadder which I can appreciate, as well. Love the super-high responsiveness of both mice and fast tracking that never faults. You cannot go wrong with either of these top-end mice."
2,"Good, clean fun",It is great to get this series all in one package. Brought back memories of watching this show when I was a kid...what can you say about Gilligan!Good to watch these again.
2,One word...YUMMY,Of course this can not compare to a real life massage but it works well for instant relief. I enjoyed the ability to turn on and off areas to focus on just the sore parts. It heats up fast and there is a built in timer. The heat stays on for another ten minutes after the vibrators stop. The only thing I don't like is the automatic shut off but I am sure there is safty reasons for it...shrug
2,Love!,We have owned this scale for 5 years. Purchased in 2007. Still working great. Gives accurate readings. Would highly recommend!
1,Poor Quality... Don't Order,"This battery is supposed a 1.5V battery. None... None(!) of the 50 batteries arrived with more than 1.3V and most were worthless at less than a volt. Shame on Amazon for letting such bogus product be sold via Amazon! Once again, if the deal looks too good to be true, it probably is!"
2,Simply Nice!,"...Such a fine piece of music. Mel, George and the producers are simply the best right here and now. I have played Bass since early 1950. This fellow . . . Brian Torff on the Bass, simply makes me happy. That's the way I might have played if I simply had the tallent that Torff has. You need a gift from God in order to play like Torff does.Thanks for still being alive!"
2,Good,"This coat rack just arrived today. Assembly was a snap and hardly took 5 minutes. This looks far more expensive than it is, and does have a really classic look. My only compliant is that the foot pegs are higher than they should have been. If they were lowered, this would have had better stability. Overall, a good buy!"
2,Excellent,"This movie surpassed all my expectations. It was very visual, beautiful sets, and great, edge of your seat action. If a speical edition of this movies come out, ill be sure to snag a copy of it. This is truly one of the greatest action/sci fi movies ive ever seen, I'd recommand you to watch it if you like sci fi movies!"
1,Not Tasty,I was disappointed that the Almased powder was so unpleasing to the taste buds due to its lack of flavor and not fully dissolving. I found it difficult to drink even when mixed with juices and other flavored liquids. I think other products are available at a better price that do the same thing and are easier to consume.
1,Too dumb,"The first movie was fantastic, but this lame second one was a real dissapointment. I too saw this movie originally in the theaters when I was in the Army. No one fires a LAW while inside of anything (even a building unless you have it well ventilated). And you also make sure that the people you are trying to rescue aren't right behind it. He would have killed everybody (other helicopter, his rescuees, and himself) had he really fired the missile.On top of that it also introduced a bunch of Russians into an era and situation that they had no reason to be in. A much much better movie is ""Uncommon Valor"".It is too bad because this could have been a great sequel."
2,Great way to keep thermostat low!,"With the high price of heating oil this winter I have been trying to keep my thermostat at 60 degrees. I found dressing in layers and/or wearing a fleece sweatshirt too bulky.I Googled for heated vests just as a lark. I knew they made heated gloves and socks for skiing but had never heard of vests. In all honesty, I had been thinking they would make a great invention and I'd soon be rich ... oh well! : (Instead I came across this vest. I received it just the other day and this is my first wearing. I love it! It is thin and lightweight and though the temp in the house is 60, I am nice and warm! (Thus alot less tempted to boost the thermostat.)I can't comment on other reviewers statements that it didn't work outside, because frankly that use was never my intent. For inside use it is terrific!An adjustable thermostat would be nice, but for inside at least, I find the temp to be great ... maybe even a bit on the 'too warm' side!"
2,Dress for Diana - a review,"Book arrived, via a friend in the US (not postable to Aust) and although the cover was a little scuffed, for the price, not bad. Love the book; just what I was looking for, and although I have only peeked through, I can tell it will be helpful in the research I need.A great memento of a happier time for both Diana and myself. Thanks :D"
2,Musical Massage Vol. One CD,"I actually picked this CD up to play as I drift off to sleep. I've had the cassett version for years but cassetts are so ""out the window so to speak"" so I decided to upgrade to the CD version. My son loved to go to sleep by this music when he was a child. Very relaxing. Arrived as listed and shipping was timely. Good purchase."
2,Great little desk fan,"I bought this in spite of a handful of negative reviews up here, and I'm posting to provide a counterpoint.The Zippi is a great little desk fan that, while nearly silent, moves a surprising amount of air. I actually put it down on the low setting because too much air in my face gets annoying. The Zippi is perfect for those of us who work in climate-controlled offices that are a little too climate-controlled in favor of the ladies who need everything uncomfortably warm. It provides just the right amount of personal airflow. No more, no less.Anyone buying this thinking it's going to cool more than their face and torso is sadly looking for something else. Like, maybe, something bigger and noisier.Great for offices/apartments ... bad for cooling large rooms in the Cayman Islands in Summer with no air conditioner. It's made by Vornado and has excellent build quality. I'd buy another if I had two faces."
2,Love it!,Received the screen fast. Didn't realize I would receive it so quickly. It workds for the purpose that I bought it for. It is perfect and I recommend it.
1,Rocky blu ray set,"I am very disapointed in this set. I have dvd set and this blu ray looks just the same. If I could return it, I would and wait for the real remasterd blu ray set. Don't waste your money."
2,needs software update,This will be a great keyboard/mouse for the Mac once either logitech or .Mac comes up with a software upgrade that is compatible for the Mac with intel!
1,A major disappointment,"""The Prestige"" wasn't really a bad movie, but it did try too hard to be altogether too clever. The problem isn't the cast who are uniformly excellent. The problem is the plot and the script which simply have too many holes, compounded by confusing presentation which jumps back and forth through time and expects the audience to keep up. Not that it's really that hard to keep up, but in the end I got the feeling that it was all just fancy footwork to keep you from realizing just how weak the plot really was.WARNING: Spoiler ahead!Without trying to spoil too much, the ending was especially lame and ultimately unsatisfying. Specifically, it morphed without warning from a well-executed character-driven picture with involving the mechanics and psychology of illusion, into a sci-fi film - and not a very good one at that. Nicola Tesla's descendants should sue everyone involved!A great actor's showcase, but still not recommended..."
1,Not a story,"Beware!! This is not a novel!! If you want an engrossing read and you want the girls from sex and the city, do not let this fool you. This book is more of an essay. Paragraph after paragraph of what appears to be the newspaper column maybe. Not novel format at all. I was real disapointed because I enjoyed Lipstick Jungle and Trading Up and Four Blondes. This book is nothing like them."
2,"Excellent Condition, Prompt Service","This order was received in excellent timing and in good condition. There were two ""calendars"" (books that matched the collection) that were unuseable and should not have been counted as part of the collection, but other than that we have no complaints."
1,The Sanitation Engineers own it now!,"It really is nothing more than a bulky non stick pan, you could do the same thing with a stove top grill pan. Why bother? Go for a propane or charcoal grill to get the real thing!After a year of not very good grilling I gave it to the garbage pick folks!"
2,Great story of redemption,"Sweet revenge at it's finest.Love, romance, long friendship gone wrong.It's all in here. Not like the movie, so don't beterribly disappointed."
1,SONY SUCKS,"this model is the same as the mdr-v250 despite the new color silver....i have had 2 pairs of them which both broke. they have terrible sound. i dont reccomend them. dont over estimate sony's reputation...you want some good headphones, never buy sonys, they suck"
1,Time to say no,"This is transparently exploitative. Despite the lame justifications noted in an entry earlier, this is simply an all too obvious stratagem to wring every last cent possible out of the goodwill generated by the original art. The prices are already obscenely exorbitant and to try to manipulate the public to ""need"" multiple releases should not be tolerated. If your Blu-Ray player up converts, you are already getting enough quality to tide you over. I can delay gratification until they get it right and stop holding us up."
1,There can be side effects.,"I took 600 mg of Alpha Lipoic Acid a day for 23 days. This was under a Dr's advise. It was to treat burning mouth which is my side affect from acid reducers. ALA took away my pain in about a week. But, on day 13 I woke up confused and couldn't remember how to take my medicine. That happened once. On day 21 I started with a mild headache. Two days later it was a migraine. Up to this point I was getting increasingly tired each day. The day of my migraine, I was so tired I slept all day. I had quit taking the ALA the day before the migraine. It took 5 days before most of my energy was back. From what I have read, I think it was playing with my blood sugar level as well as my thyroid medication. If your body can tolerate it, it does relieve pain. My Dr. told me to stop taking this."
1,Kettler Ergo Racer GT,Handlebars a disaster. Created by someone who never rode a bike. Can't stand and pedal like a spinning bike. It is quiet. Good for spinning while sitting only. Serious spinners will be disappointed. Keiser M3 a better option. Ride before buying the Kettler.
2,Cool Third Stream,"John La Porta was probably best known as a music educator, teaching at Berklee for nearly 40 years, but back in the 1940s and 50s he was a regular on the jazz scene, playing with a wide range of musicians from Woody Herman to Charles Mingus. This two-albums-on-one-CD offering from Fantasy finds the clarinetist on a previously unrelased 1958 session called ""Theme and Variations,"" and the 1956 date originally issued as ""Conceptions."" The lineup is either septet or octet, but the only names I recognized were baritone saxophonist George Barrow and bassist Wendell Marshall. (Trumpeter Louis Micci, tenor saxophonist Larry Wilcox, trombonist Sonny Russo, pianist Wally Cirillo, and drummer Clem DeRosa round out the group.) The music is easily categorized as third stream, containing elements of both classical and jazz, and I found it highly engaging. This disc has been remaindered and is currently available from a variety of sellers for a fraction of its original list price."
1,Has no one noticed Crichton isn't writing books anymore?,"The only thing missing from Crichton's last two books, and glaringly apparent in Timeline, are stage directions. He's not writing books, he's writing movie treatments. The first part of the book does get ones hopes up, but as soon as the mystery which opens the book is solved, it quickly disolves into chaotic chases, cardboard characters, and a tacked on ending. Why bother to continue to write run-of-mill stuff like this, Mr. Crichton should just stick to script writing."
1,Less than Satisfactory,"First, there are countless typos and errors, and no solutions manual. Even the answers to odd numbers in the back of the book are not well done. Some sections are very straightforward and are easy to follow step by step, while most sections leave me as mystified after the third reading as I was before I opened the book. It feels like it was written for mathematicians, by mathematicians - but that is not the average student. The people taking this class would love to know how in the world any of this applies to actual problems in engineering, physics, chemistry, etc. I would prefer a balance between the endless mindnumbing proofs, and more tangible application problems."
1,Disappointing Chocolate War Movie,"As a freshman English teacher I was very disappointed that the ending of The Chocolate War story was completely changed in the film. By allowing Jerry Renault to gain justice over Archie,The Vigils, and Brother Leon, the entire theme of the book was changed. I showed the movie to my class after we had read the book and we talked about how some writers and producers in the American entertainment industry cannot bear an unhappy or unjust ending of a story although we see this all around us in everyday life. The changed ending also takes away the powerful message in the book against the bullies of this world. Why would someone do this to a fantastic book? B. Elliott"
1,Not at all great:(,"No, no it came on time nothing wrong with the service @ all!! The movie it self was a sleeper:("
1,Really Bad Movie,"I don't go to movies or watch TV. I go by buzz and reviews. I'm just really glad I got this really cheap.It was a bad movie - I still don't know what the plot / story was supposed to be, and I doubt I'll watch it again to figure that out.Wow, really, really bad. Don't waste your money."
2,Great book on Philly Mob,"This book is very insightful into the violent and egotistical Scarfo family in Philadelphia during the 1980s. These were REAL killers who thought they were in the movies and it's amazing to see and hear where and how these events took place and then drive 30 mins to South Philly and see the real locations. The inside story from Nicky ""The Crow"" Caramandi is amazing and I even saw a show on Nat Geo channel about this story. Scarfo was a complete megalomaniac and it became his undoing, which the book explains fantastically. Highly recommended for mob enthusiasts and Philadelphians alike."
2,Tatical bipod/grip,"Great item I used it in airsoft wars. It withstands mud, rain, and snow. Great item for a very very cheap price. I bought a $50 grip/bipod and it broke in a week. Best grip/bipod ever made."
1,don't overload it,I have had the unit for about 2+ years. It is a very good 'blower'. For the first time in the 2 years I've owned it I decided to vacuum some leaves. There must have been a clump of wet ones that got sucked up into it. Within seconds the motor began to burn up. I noticed one of the blades had broken too. With the broken blade it caused it to be unbalanced and consequently did not function well. Conclusion: good blower but be wary of using it as a vacuum.
1,Not happy at all,"I first starting putting this rack together the moment I got it. Once I really got into it, I thought for sure there were pieces missing. It was not stable at all and swayed if I even touched it, forget putting bikes on it. So I tried screwing the top portion into the wall with the screw and anchor provided. It still was not at all stable and the entire thing came crashing down on me. I've now taken it apart and put it back into a box. I'm going to contact the company and ask for a refund and will never recommend this product to anyone."
2,Steve's Review,"I watched a trailer for this movie and it caught my eye. Anyone who knows me knows that I am a sucker for a ""B"" movie especially when it comes to sci fi and horror. Once you get past the stupid basic premise for this movie you will find that is a well executed action movie. For those who have not figured out the basic story Osama Ben Laden comes back as a zombie. The action stems around a spec ops team trying to find a nest of terrorists while killing zombies along the way. While weak on characterization the action sequences are pretty cool and dare I say satisfying. I won't spoil the ending except to say that Ben Laden gets what he deserves once again!! This movie is worth a look as a rental but not one I would buy."
1,At least knock a few bucks off for an older version.,"I had the 3.0 in my wishlist, and when g-ma ordered some for baby, this is what she got. I believe they ARE the 3.0s, but are probably backstock from before they started putting in the infant sized insert. Why they don't just say THAT on the description I don't know. If they want to sell them to get rid of the stock without that extra insert, they could knock a few bucks off them. I usually use them for nighttimes with my baby anyway, so I don't mind the bulk of the full sized insert.the diaper is great, the way amazon is selling them annoys me enough to knock them all the way down to 2 stars. You can get them direct from this seller for the same price with an extra insert."
2,GOOD JOB FERN,"I am only half way through this book and am really enjoying it. it is easy to read and easy to follow. I am very impressed with this author, as I have never read any of her books in the past but am awaiting her ""Hide and Seek"" CD for my car and anticipate it to be just as good."
1,Good while it lasts,"I like the idea that I don't have to keep fussing with the timer setting as the seasons change. On the plus side, it works flawlessly, but only for about two years, then it dies catastrophically. My second one in just over 4 years just suddenly failed. At $15 a pop it's just not worth it. I'm going to find a new solution."
2,"George has evolved musically, so deal with it!","I have heard mixed comments about the new Lynch Mob Cd. I have also heard, and bought it. Yes, while it is true there is none of George's acrobatic stunts of musical amazement, the new album shows that it is possible for artists to grow. This is no longer the eighties, and if you're looking for the George of old, buy a Dokken record. I personally was very pleased with the new aggressive sound. The best way for me to describe it would be somewhere between the aggressive metal sound of Sevendust, with a hint of Limp Bizkit. My hat goes off to George and his new style. George has moved on...and anyone stuck in the eighties needs to also!"
1,SO NOT ME,"i have been a depressed teenager sence i was 12-13 (about the time ms. wurtzel says she started getting seriously depressed. and i have had a knife to my wrist, i have spent whole weeks in bed and i know what it is like to look back and only be able to see your self this way. But in no way did i feel a conection with this girl, and i discourage people to read this book becasue they seem to think they come out with a better feeling and handle on how depressed people are, and my god that could not be farther from the truth, the only thing u can get out of this book in my opinion is what one girl, at different parts in her life thought as she tried to deal with her depression, that is it, i beg of u do not think u know more about being depressed if u have read this book."
1,Just plain stupid,"The movie started off well, but quickly descended into the abyss of improbability. It was so far fetched so as to be beyond the realm of possibility. Too many wild coincidences. Also, there was too much gratuitous sorrow and carnage that seemed to serve no purpose but to make the story seem... well, just plain dumb.It wasn't worth the rental fee and I'm sorry I wasted time watching it."
1,"Low Carb, But High Fat","When I ordered this book, I was expecting something along the line of high protein, low carb meals with no more than 9-15 grams of fat per serving. I was disappointed to find that a majority of what the book was recommending was 28+ grams of fat per serving. I commend anyone that has lost 60 pounds on a diet, as I have lost over 100 pounds myself, but if you are wanting to look like a model from a fitness magazine, I don't think you will achieve such results on this particular diet. It does, however have some neat suggestions that you could modify to a lower fat version, and could be a very good diet plan if your doctor has told you that carbs are causing medical problems for you."
2,good movie,"Yo, the last reviewer was way off, so just erase those thoughts from your memory. This documentary is raw and refined at the same time. There are interviews with artists such as Snoop Dog, Masta Killa, Sunz of Man, Jadakiss,Sticky Fingaz, etc. The guy making the flick is puffing ""L""s the whole time with the rappers, and just having casual conversation. I thought it was a sick soundtrack with intimate interviews that are informative at least, and incredibly entertaining regardless. Worth checking out, and definitely worth 10 bucks. There aren't enough hip-hop documentaries and this one will be a classic."
2,Great actresses=great movie!,Ladies in Lavender features 2 great actresses and a delightful story set on the English coast. The photography is wonderful and this adds to the enjoyment of the movie. Ladies in Lavender is a wonderful way to spend an evening. You will not be disappointed!
1,CRISCO OBSESSED!,"This guy is obsessed with vegetable shortening. Talk about bland cookies. Not to mention ""1001"" is a total lie. Anyone notice the 'repeat' recipes with cleverly (yeah right) disguised new names? Snickerdoodles, Nibbles and Cinnamon Balls are EXACTLY the SAME recipes... just in a different ORDER in printing. So are the Mexican Wedding Cakes (what a clever name for the IDENTICAL second version: in Spanish!). Funny that the author talks about his father on his deathbed confessing his 'secret' ingredient in the 'best' chocolate chip cookies. you guessed it: SHORTENING!Whatever happened to butter..."
1,a disappointing book,"I picked up the book due to its attractive title , and my wish to see how it feels like being more creative.While the book has a few good points, the majority is filled with rambling. I dont know much about the author Osho, but from the book, I picture him as a lunatic who is just obssessed with himself. I tried to finish reading the book, but everytime I tried, I got frustrated and put it down.Perhaps, I was too quick to jugde, but from my reading of the book so far, it was my worst buy of 2007.Still keen to read more about creativity, but I should be more selective next time."
1,Great for the winter,"This receiver runs very hot, regardless of where it is set up. There is a cooling fan attached to the back, but it has never kicked on and will supposedly do so only under heavy loads. I called Panasonic Customer Service and was told that the fan should come on and that I need to take it in for repairs. I would have been much better off buying something else. Soundwise it is very good and the built in tuner is a nice change from my old set up of having a separate tuner and amplifier. It is an affordable home theater component, but the heat issue is a real drawback."
2,"A fun, entertaining book that (by the way) has great recipes","When I opened this book, my first laugh came immediately upon seeing the photo of Livia Soprano in the kitchen on the inside cover spread. The rest of the book is great humor interspersed with authentic Italian recipes. I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of recipes included. Obviously the humor and entertainment value depends largely upon the reader being a Soprano's fan, but if you are a fan, I highly recommend this book."
1,Don't bother,"While I love Richard Simmons, after I bought the DVD I was completely discouraged, it just jumps right into the workout, he gives you no instruction & you feel completely lost. I have purchased his other workouts in the past & they were great but this one was not worth the money I paid for it."
1,No Vocals???,"Where are the songs with vocals??Forget the ""new age"" crap, the beautiful female vocal I heard during the credits is nowhere to be found.Oh well, ""new age"" = ""pointless""... at least musically.J"
1,Reactionary and dangerous,"This is nothing less than a program for the propagation of STDs and misery, wrapped in reactionary religious dogma. Beware!"
2,Yet another edition of a classic,"This isn't a how-to book for writing a novel. Nay, it is a how-to-write-just-about-anything-book. Articles. Novels. Biographies. Genealogies. I found myself gleaning tidbits throughout the book, even in sections that didn't pertain to my interest: writing novels. This is worth the read. My copy is never more than a few feet away from my writing desk.Paul Buckner, Author of:Opening Lines For Your First Novel: Forging Your Writers Craft Into A Page Turning Novel They Won't Be Able to Put Downand:From Broke To Broker: Stories of Finding Financial Freedomand:Never Give Up: Book Two of the Finding Financial Freedom Seriesand:Gabriel Jennings and the Ferret Freedom Fighters (The Free Ferret Saga)"
1,Not Intuitive,"This product is NOT intuitive and there is no reason for it not to be. I tried very hard to use it when I first bought it, and now regret throwing the money away."
1,Good for a Laugh,"The book starts off with a detailed lesson of the origin of blood types. The author used that to basically say we should eat what our ancestors ate, or at least food in the same groups. It shocked me to hear that, according to this book, Asians are consuming the wrong foods for their blood type. Most people I have seen from China and Japan are fit and healthy. The foods the book said should irritate my stomach don't and vice versa."
1,Second rate commercial pap will always suck.,"It doesn't matter when or where the music comes from, if its characterised by dull chord progressions, hackneyed lyrics and lousy production it will never stand the test of time. The songs in this compilation will NEVER NEVER make the grade. I grew up in the eighties, and this collection of truly awful radio hits is testimony to the conservatism that characterised programming at this time. Images of overweight realtors and shopping mall managers twisting and frooging to this dreck at their local beer barn permeate my tortured consciousness. Thank God Nirvana and other bands with integrity came along and changed all that."
2,Travel System is Different!,"If you are like me, you have been waiting for the single travel system in this great pattern to be available. It's in the stores now, and I RAN to Babies R Us and was told the system was exactly like the car seat...I got it home and the system DOES NOT have the faux suede fabric like the car seat in the same pattern that is sold seperately. All that wonderful butter-soft tan suede is replaced by tan canvas. Sure, it will wear better, but if you had your heart set on everything matching the carseat (as I was), prepare yourself!"
1,I Wouldn't Really Know...,"The book was never received. I emailed the seller THREE TIMES, but all I got was a generic email telling me the book was delivered. That may be true, but it was never RECEIVED by me."
1,WILL SOMEBODY GET THIS CAMERA-MAN SOMETHING TO EAT...,"...HE'S GOT THE SHAKES. AND CONSIDERING THE BUDGET THIS FILM HAD, THEY PROBABLY COULDN'T AFFORD TO FEED THE CAST AND CREW. THE CHARACTERS ARE ANNOYING, THE ACTORS ARE ANNOYING, THE CUTS ARE ANNOYING, THE CAMERA WORK IS ANNOYING IS THIS SENTENCE RUNNING ON. WELL SO DOES THIS ANNOYING MOVIE. TO BE HONEST I COULDN'T FINISH IT. BJORK IS NOT A GOOD ACTRESS OR EVEN FACTORY WORKER, BUT IT TAKES ALOT OF TALENT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE ALL THE WAY THROUGH. I WANTED TO BE AMONGST THE 50% OF THOSE WHO LIKED THIS MOVIE. HOWEVER I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THE OTHER HALF. BJORK SHOULD STICK TO WHAT SHE KNOWS, MUSIC AND PICKING FIGHTS."
2,Nice movies about the Siberian Tigers,A nice one about the Siberian Tiger. It tells about the endangered tigers of Siberia and the efforts to save them. The videography is very good and all in all it is an interesting and educative movie for wildlife lovers.
2,You can get a replacement lid!!!,"I love this teapot. I've had it for two years and it's been great. It boils water very quickly and cleans easily. The only problem I had was that I dropped the lid a few months ago and it shattered. Apparently this happens to people frequently based on the other reviews I read. I got upset because I thought I would have to buy a new teapot. However before I took the plunge, I decided to go to the manufacturer's website at: [...]and filled out a webform asking if they have replacement lids. Much to my surprise, I got a response the next day and they do sell lids for this tea kettle for $10 including shipping. This is a much better deal than buying a whole new teapot! So if you break your lid, try the manufacturer first."
1,"If I could give it a ""zero"" I would","This is the only movie I ever walked out of in the middle while attending the viewing in a theater, and I stayed an hour longer than I would have liked just hoping the movie would improve. War is not poetry no matter how beautifully filmed. All I can say is thank God the majority of soldiers do not behave in the manner portrayed in this film, we'd never win a war. I have noticed people usually either love or hate this movie, rarely falling anywhere in the middle. I most obviously fall into the loathe it catagory. I found it to be confusing, slow, and boring. My time would have been better spent cleaning out trash cans and sewing on lost buttons."
2,Works better than store bought!,"Me and my hubby have been trying to conceive for awhile now. I have PCOS and was on Clomid and for some reason, I was having a really hard time reading the results of the store bought ones. I decided to try these internet ones because I've heard good things about them and so I used them everyday and this was the first month I was able to get a clear positive. Cheap price is great too, I'm able to test everyday instead of trying to guess my fertile 7 days to use them with the expensive brands. I would highly recommend them!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this coffee maker last weekend to replace our old Mr. Coffee, thinking that the carafe would be nice to keep the coffee hot longer. Boy was I wrong. First off, the coffee doesn't even start off hot, so keeping it that way is a joke. You have to actually buy this thing and then read the instructions to find our their suggestion of pre-heating the pot. This doesn't work so well for someone who works. We get programable pots so the coffee will be made when we get up, right? Mine is going right back to the store this weekend. Don't waste your money, this coffee pot is terrible!"
2,England's best kept secret!,The latest Bluetones album is amazing....more so than their freshman Expecting to Fly. Last Chance Saloon's songs are better crafted and superbly performed. The Morris brothers have again shown up Brit's babes by producing a well-rounded and well-written extravaganza for the ears and mind.
1,Great... for Black & White... won't play color!,"My experience has been identical with other users mentioned here. The unit worked fine for a brief time, then quit playing in color - showing only black & white. I contacted CyberHome and they swapped out the unit for a new one, not super fast, but in a matter of weeks at least. Amazingly... new unit did the same after a coupleof weeks. Finally it made a popping noise and died all together. Can't see how they can stay in business like this!"
1,Don't Buy This!,I bought this and it doesn't work. I contacted and sent the seller an email but won't respond. It's a rip off. It keeps on switching sides or ejects
2,Air Tight,This thing seals nice and tight. Works well to keep flour in. A little too small to keep a large amount of rice in it. I thought it would be bigger. And of course my wife said the same thing.
1,Very TRL Feel,it made sense that Carson Daily was in this Film.it has that MTV/TRL Vibe the Fast Food Acts&Mentality.this Film was so Real because it reflects alot of the Acts out now on TRL.the type of Film that was Funny for all the wrong reasons.
1,"Excellent idea, poor implementation. Not good.","The fingering chart inside of my book is far superior to this fold out. It is difficult to see whether you are going to use the Thumb or pinky keys with this chart, as they are not displayed! This is pitiful. My daughter who plays in the Symphony even remarked that this is a very poor fingering chart for beginners."
1,Deja Vu,I found this soundtrack to be a total disappointment. It sounded like a lazy ripoff of the Gladiator and Crimson Tide soundtracks.It's just a shame the soundtrack didn't live up to the movie's originality.
2,clock repair,the book is very good but what i found out is that i already own this book mi guess 2 is better than one.ihave other booik and thyis i would rate as very good j mailler
2,"Perfect when cycling,","I found it little disturbing when running (it was always bumping on my chest and hitting my polar chestband) but its o.k. while cycling I found it comfortable to wear than any other gear. good resistance to sweat, it was always wet of sweat and still working. like all radios signal faints when batteries weaken."
1,A Primer on the Shih Tzu,"""Dr. Ackerman's Book of Shih Tzu"" is a good starting point. It has excellent photos illustrating dental hygiene, nail trimming, ear cleaning and paw trimming. This book gives good suggestions on choosing a puppy and the Shih Tzu's nutrition. If you are a beginner with this breed and just want an overall view, this would be a good book to start with."
2,A GREAT COMBINATION,"Briar Rose is a wonderfull storie combining fairy tales, history, romance and even a touch of mistery. Jane Yolen puts a surprising twist on the storie we all grew up with, Sleeping Beauty. No one is to young or to old for this book, I recamend it to all ages."
1,Arbeit Macht Frei,"Ben Dupree's seminal work on the inner workings of Reed College marvelously highlights the decay of an institution represtentative of a period in the American epoch typified by the pursuit of happiness through all the facets of the human experience. Dupree proves a worthy representitave of a growing segment of the student population more concerned with cultivating the mind to the detriment of the soul in the hopes of devolving into the most efficient cog biologically viable. Laugh, cry, and rue the day as you skim over this masterpiece of human malformation."
1,This Indiana boy thought it was alright,"Yes Tournament Upstart was a pretty good book if you ask me, but it could have been better. There were very heart warming parts in this book, but there were also parts that left me wondering what was going on. I liked the story about them off the court, but I thought the game scenes could be a little more discriptive. Now and then I thought the writer didn't know what he was talking about. There were times in some of the games were I was lost and confused (might just be me). The reason I read the book was to get some good basketball action like the state tournament around here, and I didn't get any out of this book. The games weren't described in enought detail for me (again probably just me). There were many times I felt there was something familiar about the story (anyone seen the movie Hoosiers?), the coach's motivational speeches were just a little familiar. This is what kept me from really liking the book but all in all it was alright."
2,Shred It Up!!!,"I bought this for my wife, as she is always looking for new workout DVDs and she LOVES it. She said it is brutal, but it is good!"
1,Not as good as expected,"I applied this twice and it went on spotty and I found I had to re apply every other day. Wasn't a fan of the smell, but that's normal for sunless tanners. I stopped using it and went back to Jergens Glow, at least that goes on even. The best sunless tanner I have used, although expensive, is Sun Goddess."
2,"Great recipes, unusable index","On the positive side, this book is useful for both beginners and experienced cooks interested in charcuterie. The recipes are well laid out, and the background information is sufficiently detailed to be truly useful. The passion of the authors is evident, and some of the sausage recipes, in particular, are not usually found in standard works on the subject. An excellent example is the Country Venison Sausage.Items that need improvement are:There is cross-referencing from recipes to technique sections, where the technique is at odds with the specifics of the recipe.Also, the index is absolutely useless in the Kindle book - headings and subsections are indistinguishable due to lack of indentation, and there is no hyperlinking. Obviously page number references are pointless. This is a serious shortcoming with the Kindle edition, and I sincerely hope it can be rectified in future Kindle editions of this otherwise excellent book."
2,'Nuff said,"This game is just a blast to play - by yourself, but especially with friends. The controls are easy to pick up, the game chatter is witty and flowing, and the gameplay graphics are outstanding. Stringing together long combinations for bonus points will keep you going for hours. ""Street"" has three different difficulty levels, so you can vary the challenge from the CPU, and on none of the levels are your players perfect, an annoyance found in other games. On top of this, the ability to build your own players and teams to compete against NBA legends really makes this the best basketball game ever."
2,Waiting for life to end,"Last of the Summer Wine is the soft, amusing tale of a whole world of characters living out the end of life in a childish search for meaning. They exist and wander in a lush, colorful world of a government financed time warp that was England before anyone had to work at living. The memories of a childhood interrupted by a war they ""won"" are interlaced with an endless supply of frustrations from the peace they ""lost"", and the daily attempts to find some form of solace in the Yorkshire hills. The characters are timeless, the fun surprising yet gentle on the mind. It is obvious why this televison show has lasted so long."
2,THE NUMBER 1 BOOK!,"I think that Many Moons is one of my favorite books. I like it because it has details that you can imagen easily. For exaample it says in the story that the royal wizard was a little,thin man with a long face. He wore a high red peaked hat covered with silver stars,and a long blue robe covered with golden owls.My favorite part of the story was the ending.I like this part because it leaves you wondering,doesthe court Jester have magical powers? You also wonder,how could a Joker know what to do? If Many Moons was in a best book competition, Many Moons would win! That is why I like Many Moons. THE END!"
2,Comprehensive and simplistic,This is a comprehensive guide to leadership coaching. It's a review of many authors' previous work or ideas so it has appealfor the seasoned coach although I did not find much new material. It is probably better for 'new to the field' coaches who want to know a lot of information in one source. The chapters are short and easy to read. For seasoned coaches it is helpful to pick and choose. I especially liked Nancy Adler's chapter on Coaching Global Executives: Women Succeeding in a World Beyond Here. She ended with a good reason for executives to chose coaching.
2,"A Man of Wonder, A Beautiful Book","At the age of ten, I discovered the stigmatist, Padre Pio - a man of many wonders. To a ten year old, he was a super hero, a man of many powers. As an adult, he is still a super hero to me, but in another way. Padre Pio embodied all that is holy and was yet so human.Meet Padre Pio is a wonderful book. We see Padre Pio as a human, not just a saint and a holy man. This book takes us from his early days as a child all the way to his death and beyond. We meet a charming man with a beautiful soul. We experience the first appearance of his stigmata and the many miracles that follow. Many of his relationships with friends and family are intimately revealed and show a very caring man with a wonderful sense of humor.Whether you consider yourself religious or not, pick up this book. It is a wonderful read which introduces a marvelous man to it's readers. You can't help but smile when you read this book!"
2,finding buck mchenry by: erik cartmen,"The book finding buck mchenry was a great baseball book. In the book an older man named Mack Henry. At first he says that he was the great Buck Mchenry but after he lies about it to a television crew he confesses that he is not who he said he was. Mack Henry coach a three person three person team called the grandstand. the grandstand won almost every game that they played. i liked this book because everthing in the book had to do with baseball, and baseball is my favorite all around sport.erik cartmen"
1,What happened here....,"I know that many gave this album only one star. And this is for a reason! DJ Shadow went from laying down the dopest beats in the business to sounding like some little cheap rapper like Lil Jon. What Happened Shadow? I have a really hard time listening to popular rap on MTV because it always lacks....substance. Well, unfortunately for me (because I am a huge DJ Shadow fan), his new music fits into this category. Hyphy is terrible.no....noo....nooooooo.....come back shadow.....come back....."
1,NO TALENT,"I guess if I didn't know anything about music or guitar playing I might like this. But seeing as how I'm not a complete ignoramous I know that Slash is a hack. His playing has no emotion, like Hendrix or Clapton, it's all machismo, and that is why he will be remembered as a bloated has-been."
1,What?!,What was this. I didn't listen to this (not that I would want to) but this has to be the worst thing ever invented.
2,Really useful,"This is a nifty little book as a refrence and a aid to learn some of the symbols, i would recomend Duquette's book along with this as it is awesome!!!! My only peeve is the lack of page color for the cards. I am sure this would have made it more expensive but i say it would be worth it."
1,Power Charger,"The power charger seems to work fine, but the batteries dont hold much of a charge. Definitely not what I was hoping for, hence why I give it 2 stars. At least the charger seems to work."
1,"Review of ""The Lost Plates of Wilford Eng"" by Thomas Orton","It is ironic. Some books have great themes but get written about with little substance. Others are written with great beauty and poetry but have nothing to say.This book is of the former.Wilford Eng was a wonderful photographer. Of this, there can be no doubt. However, Orton seems to be playing upon the Eng unknowns or created unknowns so he can have something to make up for his lack of imagination. Otherwise, why would he pack his book with erotic sex and the like? If it is not sex that he is writing about then he digs up betrayal at every other dark corner of his almost literature of third rate porn.Now, all this may be excused if we, the reader comes away with a better understanding of himself, circumstance and philosophy. Don't hold your breath as you will not. The only reason for holding your breath is to stop the bad smell of a rotten novel and time wasted reading it."
2,An Art Educator Staple,"Design Synectics is a stand out browse and reference text for Art educators. I would also highly recommend this book to any creative person. It is like a service manual for the artist/ divergent thinker. Presenting individual visual and cognitive concepts in a schematic that is easy to read and fun to practice. While some of the action items in this book may seem a little too structured, individual educators will have little trouble in customizing the approaches to fit with their style. While many books written for Art teachers only give outdated product based ideas, Design Synectics gives insight into the thinking associated with visual literacy. This book is a true Art educator staple."
1,Not as expected,"I bought this as a gift, thinking it was an episode per chef and it was only ONE meal. That's it. One of the meals was just a desert. I would not get the 3 chef collection again."
2,oh sunshine day!,"There's some great recipies, but there's also some really odd ones. I mailed some double trouble chip cookies to a really good friend of mine. That was 4 years ago and he still remembers them and says they were his favorite. I love the recipies for tortillas and boiling water."
2,"If you want to understand manipulative people, this is the book!","Having been married to a manipulative person for 13 years and recently divorced, I can say that living with manipulative people is mentally exhausting! This book has helped me to better understand manipulative people, and I'm learning to recognize such behaviors in other people...even children! If you want to understand manipulative people and why they do what they do, this is the book for you!"
1,Transferred from scratched Vinyl,"The songs are superb, vintage sixties pop. Polygram/Verve should have taken the time to go back to the original masters, and restore and digitally process the sound. The Righteous Brothers had rich voices, which with Phil Spector's production, probably gave birth to the Power Ballad. But on this collection, you can still hear the pops, hiss, and scratches that sound like a cassette tape recording from my old vinyl collection. For a major recording company to produce something like this is embarrassing. If you like the Righteous Brothers, find another collection. You will be terribly disappointed with this CD."
1,Disappointing.,I wish I would have been able to look at this photography book in one of the local book stores before ordering it. The two photographs on the front cover are the best ones. That's probably the reason why I expected so much more. I judged the book by its cover. I wasn't impressed by the photographs and the printing wasn't as crisp as one would expect from a newer photography book. The information was the same as in most photography books I already own and therefore I didn't learn anything new.I would not recommend this book. I returned it.
2,"It's a great machine, but not perfect","The machine is easy to use. The speed of routing calculation is great. Generally it's a great helper for a driver that doesn't care directions much like me.I also notice some problems with the machine. It's very diffcult to use the machine at the downtown areas of large cities. I used it several times in downtown Chicago and the performance is generally disappointing. The satellite signals would easily get lost, I believe, due to high buildings around. With 2008 map installed, the machines give quite a lot of wrong instructions regarding many one-way streets. I made a wrong turn following the instruction and avoided several others. Either the city changes the one-way signals a lot or the map is simply unrealible in Chicago downtown."
2,The Lion's Game,Excellent Mystery. Kept me in suspense and could not hardly put the book down until the end.Loss lots of sleep until I finished the book. Highly recommend for other mystery lover's to read.The author is one of the best.
2,Great as a gate for small pets,"I bought this gate as a pet gate for my two rabbits, both of whom live indoors. It's just tall enough for them to not be able to jump over, and just low enough for the smaller one to not be able to crawl under - plus my cats can jump over it if they want in or out of the room. I also liked the fact that it's two solid pieces, so there are no small holes for little paws or ears to get pinched in or small heads to get caught in. The installation was easy, and it seems sturdy enough. Having dealt with $100+ gates, some stating that they were specifically for pets, that pets can get caught in and that aren't sturdy enough to last as long as they should for the price, if I only have to replace it every year or two, I'll still feel like I got my money's worth."
2,"Been there, done that","If you've ever been asked ""What do you do all day?"" after you've spent the last umpteen hours fixing mac n' cheese, putting wheels back on a Tonka truck and having tea with Barbie, this book is for you. Amy Scheibe captures the feelings of all stay-at-home moms on the brink of desperation with both sensitivity and humor. It's Desperate Housewives, Manhattan style. Read it when the kids go for their naps."
1,Could be duplicate,"I have never tried an Armani product before, but when a couple of friends at work wore this perfume, I had to buy one. I take special interest in the way I smell and thought this would be worth it. Inspite of being suggested to buy at another online store I bought it here. I am sorry to say this seems to be an aftermarket/duplicate version that I received. It has no top, bottom or middle notes. It doesn't stay at all. I never bothered to return this. But be careful"
1,Very Disappointed,"I was greatly disappointed in this bookIt does NOT have:Answer keynor examples1st set of 15 is just 2 pages to practice writing, then you turn the page and it gets right into the "", but with only 1 example of the ones covered and then it starts right in on writing and reading without even an answer keyThis book is not for the true beginner and certainly not for self-study.Yes it has a lot of practice; but I am a complete beginner trying to learn on my own without a class. Therefore, I need at least 1 example of how each one is written and an answer key to know that I am on the right track - which is missing from this book.If anyone knows of a truly helpful book that offers PRACTICE in both Reading and Writing - WITH an ANSWER KEY - I would truly appreciate it.I can't understand how so many books, including this one, get away with not having an answer key and yet call themselves beginning books."
2,Sensual Food,"Wonderful movie with low budget about love, sensuality, friendship, kindness against suffocating opression of the religion and puritanity. Mozart aria from Don Giovanni fits perfectly the theme of this marvelous movie. It makes a person to think twice about the life paths and decisions and most of it, it's full with hope. To enjoy and remember !!!!"
2,Such a helpful book,"My mother died when I was 11 and now I'm 22 and getting married. I was really feeling bad about her not being at my wedding and I was dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety. This book helped me so much in realizing why I was the way I was growing up and what I can expect along the way. I would highly recommend this book for any daughter that has ever lost a mother, even if she wasn't lost through death."
2,Great value,"Great value protein, tastes great and easy to mix in the shaker. Taste is great but not the best, comparing to more expensive products."
1,Not a must have! -must have is a maketing ploy.,"I got his lamb and found out it's just another baby thing that will be seldom used. Babies don't really care about the ocean, whale or the rain sounds, they don't know what those sounds are! This lamb with sounds are more geared for adults who find them relaxing. It's a cuddly stuff toy, minus the velcro at the back. Good marketing though by making it sound like it's something every parents must have. I say not!"
2,Truly Inspiring,"I don't usually listen to ""New Age"" music, but about ten years ago I was spending the night at a friends house and she put this CD on as we went to sleep. I absolutly fell in love. This album transports you to the windy, snow swept arctic. Visions of black, starry skies and endless polar plains are portrayed in this beautiful music. If you purchase one album for relaxation and inspiration-buy this one. You won't regret it."
1,"Generally, I LOVE Action Movies. This one was TERRIBLE.","This was literally one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. It has really dumb sucker humor (jokes based on old humor you've already heard in other movies) and images of explosions/heavy artillery in lieu of good acting or film-making. And every Pakistani in this movie is a terrorist or influenced by a terrorist? Why is that a normal plot device and not just using racial stereotypes to shortcut having to do anything creative?The plot is incredibly well-worn and completely predictable, if even in pieces. You may not know how the scene or situation will start (i.e the twists and turns some people allude to) but once the scene has started you can immediately pick the three most likely scenarios that will ensue, and be right. Is that comforting to you, in an action film? if so, this is the film for you. If you expect something more fun or smart, with good action or good plot, I say pass this one up. You can definitely find better."
2,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,I recently purchased this blender sponge and HIGHLY recommend it. I have used other sponges and none compare to this one. It truly blends well and gives the illusion of wearing no makeup at all. It's a worthwhile purchase. I also purchased the cleaner for the sponge which I like as well. It's not sudsy so it doesn't take forever to rinse out. Get them both if you can. Great purchase.
2,Cozy Sleepy Chair,Both my baby and I love the Baby Papasan. The music is VERY soothing and the vibrations are also very soothing. I have two vibrating chairs though for the baby now because the Baby Papasan is great for napping and relaxing but we bought a different chair (the Aquarium bouncer) for an activity chair. If you are looking for something that your baby can play in - this is not the chair for you. But if you are looking for a place for your baby to relax - this is the chair!! It is cozy - the reversible blanket is great and has velcro at the bottom which attaches to the chair and creates a sleeping bag type blanket. the material is VERY soft and the baby just snuggles up in it. I love the fact too that it's not full of baby patterns - it is also very sturdy and easy to carry if you need to move the baby to another room.
2,The flunking of Joshua T. Bates,"Dear viewers, I am rating this book five because it has humor and funny illustrations. Josh flunked 3rd grade. He was very upset. The day he got to school, every kid was smaller and the teacher was like a tank. I'm leaving it up to you. It is a high-level book! (...)"
2,lets hang out,"These hangers are the cats meow, there is not a lot to say about what they do, but they do it well...,"
1,Very disappointed,"I followed the instructions exactly but my son was able to pry the edge up almost immediately with his two bottom teeth. I really wanted this to work, but it was a waste of money. Get the fabric ones instead!!!"
1,mixed feelings,"its a very well made documentary and very educational.i would like to say that i support PETA but i cant. i fully believe in everything that they are doing for the animals (minus the hypocritical killings) but dont like how they try to make their points. in Ingrid's eyes, ""there is no bad publicity"" yet there really is.there are many people that are completely turned off by PETA's outrageous tactics and think anyone that tries to support animal rights is nuts. in fact, simply doing a peaceful protest against puppy mills draws a lot of these people to poke fun, say we're crazy and assume that we are a part of PETA, which we are not.PETA has done some good but has also damaged the name of animal activists and advocates for eternity. we are stuck fighting even harder for the animals because of what they have done."
2,Good overall guide,"I bought this book for our recent trip to Ireland because I like the Eyewitness guides and have used them for other travel. The Ireland guide did not disappoint. It is very thorough and has nice maps at the front and back of the book. It also has small maps of local areas that are really helpful whether you are driving yourself or just following the route on a bus trip. They have nice sections in the back with hotel and restaurant listings by city too. If you want a good overall book to use on your trip, I recommend this one."
2,Quick and Easy,"This was an easy stocking to complete. The hardest part was embroidering the beard after appliquéing it to create a quilted look. I have done a few stocking kits by Dimensions/Felt Works and find they are easier then stocking kits by Bucilla; they have less pieces and the directions are step-by-step pictures well Bucilla's are written step-by-step without the pictures. If you have never done stocking from a kit before, this kit would be a great first try."
1,Kills my computer,"I got the router working without significant problems. However, I bought it on the promise that I could plug in a hard drive to the USB and share it with computers on my network. Turns out it doesn't expose a share -- you have to install d-link's ""network usb utility"" on each computer that will see the drive. I installed this, and immediately got a blue screen of death on my vista machine. Rebooting just led to more kernel failures. I couldn't uninstall in safe mode, and there was no configuration option to turn it off. Eventually, I was able to unplug the network and reboot successfully, and after trying to uninstall from a full reboot I got...another blue screen of death. Router may work fine, but this feature is a dud."
1,An interesting book....,"I had to take a class in college and everything was based on this book. I thought that the book was totally pointless. Some of the sentences were so long that by the time I finished reading it, I forgot what it was about. The chapters also all linked together and so if you missed a page, you were lost. I also think that the information was also very difficult to understand. The sentences were all jumbled together and I thought that anyone could write a book of this level. I understand that the topic of social research is a difficult thing, but this book seemed to only make it worse."
2,"The ""definitive version of Suspiria?""","First, there are many reviews pertaining to this films content so I will skip that except to say that the film is indeed quite pretty and stylishly shot.The main point I want to address is the complete lack of subtitles. I was very disappointed to find that despite the fact that the original language track is included on this disc there are no subtitles to allow those with no understanding of Italian to view and comprehend the film this way.I do wonder, however, if perhaps this was a decision made based on the idea that reading the subtitles would distract the viewer from the films hailed visuals. Anyway, just a word of warning for the purists out there as I was rather shocked and upset by this intiailly."
1,I had no other choice but to read this book.,"This is the only book that I had to read on my flight to Florida. I was trapped! I did not like or sympathize with any of the characters. Wait, yes I did, the dog. He was the only one who was real. Self centered garbage."
2,Great game!,"I must say this was a guilty pleasure. I don't really like nsync but I saw this game for only 12 dollars and had to get it. It was actullay preety fun,but not enough fun to last awhile. The games on the cd rom were alright. I had a lot of trouble on the triva though.Here is my review on each game.Charity Challenge- I didn't like this to much. It just wasn't that fun.Trivia- This was hard for me since I am not an nsync fan. Really big nsync fans will have no problem on this though.Bowling- This was pretty cool. I love to bowl so this was pretty cool to have on this game. The guy's heads are drawn on to five of the pins and they talk every now and then. Very cool!Quick change- I kinda like this. It was pretty fun but each guy has the same outfits. They should have given each guy their own clothing.Make a Move- My fave. I think I like this one because I like rytym/dance games. This was kinda like a dance game in a way.So there you have it, my review. Very great for some nsync fun!!"
2,Excellent collection,"This book had and excellent collection of soups! I could even find a few south Indian soups in it and I was amazed. It has clear step by step directions with illustrations, so even a beginner will find it easy. Its a useful book to have in Ur kitchen!"
1,Very disappointed,"This poacher has worked well for the past two months we've had it. However, the eggs always stick to the poaching cups even with the use of oil and the cups are difficult to clean. Also, the pan started to chip and rust after the third use. We wash it by hand and use a mild soap but the chipping keeps getting worse. I can't recommend this product because the quality of the pan is poor."
2,Excellent condensation of an often misunderstood theory,"Hinshelwood provides the clinician with an important synopsis of Mrs. Klein's approach to the understanding of the patient's unconscious. His digestion and presentation of her theory of the development of the mind and symbol representation enables even the neophyte analyst a wonderful insight into the world of Klienian theory. Rather than assuming the reader is well-versed in the terms of Klienian theory, he provides a easy to read primer of her concepts of the development of the mind. In addition, one would profit from this tome if reading other challenging authors such as Bion who assumes his reader is conversant in Kleinian theory."
1,Interesting at times,"Fairly good thriller that is too often self-indulgent to author's prejudices and just plain cruel at times. The characters are weak and that can sink the best story for me. After slogging through this overlong opus, you may feel that you put more effort into reading this than the author did writing it. There's certainly deeper thought in some of these reviews than any place in this novel. But as a thriller, I give it a pass."
1,Too cumbersome,"The program is cumbersome to use. I never use it anymore. After I got Windows Vista, I put a [...] gadget on the desktop and use that, which is much better."
2,Mine is fine,There were prior reviews complaining about the quality and color of this item. Mine arrived with no issues at all. The finish is good and the color matches the online image.
1,Very uncomfortable,"The straps are very uncomfortable. The handle for carrying the bag like a briefcase is not on top of the bag, but goes between the two shoulder straps instead. So when you put the bag on your shoulder, that strap hits the back of your neck. Very uncomfortable.Note also that the picture of the bag open (which shows the handle on top) is of a different bag."
1,Replay factor zero,For metallica fans it may be a source of a whole lot of new information but in the end when you have seen it once maybe twice there is nothing to go back to it for. Its basically a set of interviews with short clips of the five singles in the background.
2,Speakers with concert stadium sound,WOW... talk about taking a concert stadium home in a box! These speakers are the envy of everyone in the office! Fantastic look and awesome sound makes these speakers stand out above all others. They are easily setup and installed; completely hidden behind or under the monitor; with easy access one touch control on the desktop top for speakers or headphones (sold seperately). I don't think I could go with another brand after these.
2,A charming picture book about the plucky Henrietta the Hen,"Based on a true story of a girl's pet hen who would sneak into the family home through the cat door and lay an egg on the child's colored quilt, The Chicken Without A Coop by Kathleen Cameron is a charming picture book about the plucky Henrietta the Hen who, when left behind by her human family, befriends Columbus the Cat and his young owner Katy. Simple and inviting color illustrations by John Wilson add a special touch to this heartwarming story of acceptance."
2,My review and a Q regarding the negative reviews....,"I have just recently discovered Secret Garden and vastly enjoy their music. As I am new to their music and I have no other (yet) - this CD is perfect for me. I anticipate I will check track names (to avoid duplication if possible) on other albums, then purchase more of their lovely music. I do have a Q after reading a number of ""negative"" reviews in which were complaints that this CD is a disappointing compilation of previous releases. Am I unusual in that I ALWAYS read track names before purchasing any album? It is puzzling to me that a number complained that they discovered this was a compilation POST-purchase. I am thinking the clear resolution to avoiding such disappointment is to read relevant information FIRST. Just thinking aloud. (-:"
2,Life Skills Activities for Secondary Students with Special Needs,I just started using this book 1 month ago with a developmentally handicapped class in our secondary school. I have been looking for months for suitable resources. I really recommend this book. The students are enjoying the discussions and completing the activities.
1,Yet Another Casualty of World War I,"Having just seen OH, WHAT A LOVELY WAR, I realize now that the director who so arrogantly decided to mangle A CHORUS LINE had already had experience in turning a unique theatrical success into a turgid overblown film. Richard Attenborough can be added to a select list of talented film directors (including John Huston and Francis Ford Coppola) who should never have been entrusted with the filming of successful musicals. [Who could have guessed that Josh Logan would prove equally inept?] On the other hand, if you enjoyed the film versions of FINIAN'S RAINBOW, PAINT YOUR WAGON or CAMELOT, you might like this one. I found it a pretentious, crashing bore and a criminal waste of talent."
1,An excellent book for those who do not wish to learn finance,"I used to be ""illiterate"" in terms of finance and I thought that this book would help me to comprehend the basic principles of corporate finance. Unfortunately, the content of this book is completely implicit. The authors wrote a book without taking into account the nature of the audience. Consequently,this book does not address to financial managers or to any kind of managers or even students. The only people who can really understand the content of this book is the authors themselves!After having read many books regarding corporate finance and financial management, I have become familiar with this discipline. There are hundreds of well-structured remarkable books that you can purchase at a lower price..."
1,Bratz turn kids into bratz!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't know what they were thinking! Bratz are garbage. We don't need 4 year olds wearing hip huggers! I hate bratz! They're turning kids into clones of Britney Spears!! At least Barbie wears appropriate clothing. Geeez, they don't even have noses. Congratulations, NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TheY're SSSSSSSOOOOOOOOO ugly!!! I hope they go out of business!!"
2,An emotionally powerful statement,"Reading Conroy's LORDS OF DISCIPLINE was difficult and painful, but an experience I recommend to all. I felt his love/hate relationship with his school, and was angered with him at the cruelty and disregard for the human psyche. Yet I cheered with him with each of his successes. It can't be easy to do a fictionalized expose of something you hold so dear, and I applaud Conroy's thoughtful balance and loving restraint as he tells this awful, awesome tale. Read this, but be prepared to have trouble putting it down."
2,Represent,"Jay keep doing your thing baby, more prosperity, and wealth, keep your integrity, and shine on. BIG OHIO STATUS ONE"
1,VERY UPSET,"IM DISSAPOINTED IN GAMECUBE. ALL OF THE OLD NINTENDO SYSTEMS HAVE HAD GOOD GAMES THAT HAD MAJOR ACTION AND VIOLENCE. IVE HAD THE GAMECUBE SICE IT HAS BEEN OUT.HERE ARE THE PROS AND CONS ABOUT THIS SYSTEM.PROS- 1)ORIGIAL GAMES LIKE THE MARIO CLASSICS.2)IT IS A SMALL SYSTEM THAT IS LIGHTWEIGHT.3)GREAT CONTROLLER STYLE.CONS- 1)GAMES ARE PATHETIC AND BORING TO TEENS(VERY FEW GOOD GAMES)2)SYSTEM FREEZES UP SOMETIMES OR CAN SCRATCH DISKS.3)MEMORY CARDS CAN NOT HOLD MUCH MEMORY.I WOULD RECOMMEND THE XBOX BECAUSE THE GAME CHOICE HAS GREAT TOPICS. THE GRAPHICS ARE UNBELIEVABLE AND MEMORY IS STORED IN THE XBOX.I HOPE YOU WILL LISTEN TO THIS. DON'T GET ME WRONG, BUT THE GAMECUBE IS A GOOD THING FOR KIDS 10 AND UNDER.FAREWELLAND BY THE WAY, MY NAME ISNT GLORIA, IM A BOY WHOS 14"
1,I was expecting more...,"This movie appeared to be very inventive, like it was going somewhere. I kept hoping something would happen...but it never did. I just...I don't know. There was too much lakcing in this movie. Jude Law was really good in this movie...or so I thought. But Leigh wasn't all that great. This movie just didn't do it for me. I was unimpressed. Especially with the end."
2,"Handel: Concerti Grossi, Op. 3","Handel: Concerti Grossi, Op. 3 is a recording under the direction of Christopher Hogwood who leads the Handel & Haydn Society on this Decca Record Limited release from 1989. Donald Burrows has written the liner-notes and one also gets a short description of the Handel & Haydn Society. Classic Handel at its best. Highly recommended. 5/5."
1,Don't buy Audiovox,"You might want to think twice about buying an Audiovox phone. I've had one for 2 1/2 months now. Well, I've actually had it only 2 months. It took a little over two weeks for the company to repair it when it stopped getting any signals.But, less than 24 hours after I got it back the phone another problem! This time with the keypad. Audiovox won't let the dealer replace it. It's gotta be sent back again.So, bad quality, bad repair, and bad customer service. Buy at your own risk."
2,It works,It works in my phone that I purchased it for. Fairly priced considering the phone store I got the phone at wanted double the price. I'm happy with it.
2,"Good, Better, Best","The best ""how to"" book I've ever read - Well organized detailing exact procedures in plain English - Includes treatment protocols for virtually every pathology - Information on where to purchase the best color materials and how to easily construct lamps and color boxes.Lists analogous audio frequencies corresponding to the spectral colors, so the book is also an ultrasound manual - On a scale of 1-5, this book is better than sex..."
1,Ummmm,"I read reviews b4 i watched this and i tried to keep in mind how old this movie is. I thought the music definately ruined it. It made it more corny than anything. I don't really have too much to say on this one. If u want to watch it, watch the remake. It was definately better in my notion."
1,not worth it!!!,"This book started out good with a great premise and touching life changing choice, but after that it was just a blob of self pitty and the characters were just strange, except the life of the handicap child. Another problem with this book is the writers style. The need to describe every single moment and memory of each character in every single circumstance makes this book not flow well at all. It is not a good read. I would not recommend this book to anyone!"
1,Bad,"I will never understand these 7+ minute remixes on latter Jamiroquai singles, they are looping, monotanous and bad. Also this cd cmes in the dreaded slipcase tray. Maybe they were good for early 90's dancefloors but now they are redundant. this single is no exception with 2 very long remixes and a radio edit of the title track. Would not recommend unless you are a completist, in which case get the 8track USA maxi release."
1,Disappointed That Kindle Version Isn't Available,I would love to review this book however there is no Kindle version available therefore I won't read this book. There is an audio version available for $20 to download but I don't want an audio version. I want to read it! I'm extremely disappointed that I read the first 4 books in this series and now can't read the 5th book. I spent a lot a money on a Kindle and I expect to have all books in a series available to read. I'm not disappointed in the book and author but in Amazon/Kindle or the publisher. Thumbs down to Amazon or the publisher (whoever is responsible for this)!
1,Very poor quality,"The product does work as described, but the the durability is pathetic. It's just made cardboard and plastic film. Wont last a day with my kid. Returning."
2,No! Can't Keep This a Secret At All,Emma Corrigan is hillariously witty and charming just like the heroine of the Shopaholic series! I was doubled over in laughter throughout the entire book. Don't miss this one if you enjoy a rip-roaring laugh!!
1,Great movie but poor quality,"I loved this movie and I thought it was great. The problem is the quality coming from the Amazon stream. I have a HD TV and the quality of the stream was very poor. Since I've streamed from Netflix and Hulu, I know this is because of Amazon and not because of my equipment. I won't stream again from them!"
2,this cd is GREAT!!!!!,"anyone who wants to be cheered up fast should get this cd. it's the most uplifting cd ever! if you like this one, try all the other hanson cds. you will not be disappointed! also, if you want something a tiny bit less ""poppy"" try the moffatts."
1,"junk, junk, and more junk",I got this folding dryer rack because it looked like one i've had for 12 years and is still in good shape...I got this set it up and the thing is so crooked its funny... my mistake for not taking the word of others...please don't be as foolish as me... stay away from this piece of junk... and i do mean JUNK...
1,Waste of Money,Do not waste your money! A couple of hooks broke in setting it up. After having it for a few months I walked in my closet to find more hooks had broken and my purses were all over the floor. I only had 1 purse per hook and they were not large/heavy purses by any means. This is a cheap product that is not built to last whatsoever. You will be better off creating your own holder with some sturdy clips and rope from a hardware store. I bet chip clips would work better than this lousy thing I bought on the internet.
1,Terrible!,"This is one of the most user UN-friendly devices I have ever purchased. I have several bluetooth devices which are easy to setup and work great. These headphones take a great deal of trial and error and guest work to set up. When I finally did get them up and running, the sound quality was very disappointing.I am amazed how (apparently) difficult it is to build good sounding stereo headphones (I could care less about stereo phonecalls). I would give this product ""0"" stars-but that is not an option."
2,Another good one by Joe Kane,"Have you read Kane's Running the Amazon? Here's another good one. It even won the Bay Area Book Reviewers Assoc Award in 1995. Kane travels to Ecuador to live for a while with the Huaorani tribal people as their Stone Age culture bumps against the 20th Century.The Huaorani eventually befriended Kane, but at the beginning, it was just as likely that they might murder him, as they had fairly recently killed a missionary and several others they considered enemies. Something about Kane made them feel comfortable - lucky for him.Kane intersperses magical vignettes of tribal life with historical and sociological information in a way that makes his book imminently readable by ordinary readers like me as well as my scholars and sociologists.It's a good one."
1,blah,this movie is the worst movie in the 07 set and i would not buy this movie maybe rent it if you just have to see it
2,First time comic reader left very happy. 4.5 Stars.,"This is the first time I've read anything even resembling a comic book, and I really liked it. I decided to read it because my dad, who is pretty picky with what he reads, read this book and loved it, so I decided to give it a try, and I'm very happy I did.Don't go into this expecting it to be a light reading, cheesy super hero comic. This is a very serious novel of staggering depth, with lots of psychological elements and well defined characters. A surprisingly deep read.My only real complaint about this novel is that some of the attempts at humor are a little dry. For example, in the first chapter, someone says something to Rorschach along the lines of ""You have friends now? I guess you changed your deodorant."" luckily there are only a few little things like that. All that aside, it's a great, unpredictable read. Highly recommended, even if you've never read a graphic novel."
2,To be or not to be,Great compilation. It's good to hear Fish singin' YES music & other sounds like Genesis. Excelent extra tracks and different versions.
1,Who are these guys?,"I never heard of this band until I was browsing allmusic.com and they happen to mention them in the Pink Floyd listing.I have been quite the Anglo-file for about 40 years now and I never heard of them! After giving them a listen, I know why!Nirvana and other U.S. band were influenced by this?!Do me a favor, check out Gang of Four, they got it all over these guys!"
2,"Why is word ""Barbarians"" edited out of blu-ray","I'm a long time fan of this film so it was only natural to want to add the blu-ray to my collection. Impressive boxed set and picture quality. But what I am not impressed with is their editing out the word ""barbarians"" in one of the films most memorable lines ""We'll teach these barbarians a lesson in western efficiency."" What gives? If their going to alter the film in such ways it should come with a disclaimer. I was going to donate my dvd copy but I think I'll keep it now."
1,Stick with Gu or Clif Shots,"I'm not sure if it's the flavor or the brand, but I don't like the taste of this. It has a very artificial flavor. I've never had any issues with Gu or Clif Shots, so I'd stick with those if I were to buy again."
1,Liked it until it broke today,"I bought this May 2012 and today it decided to stop working and the motor started smoking and melted. I have only had it for 3 months and I was not using this juicer on a daily basis just a few times a month. Sucks that I can't do anything about this, they should have some type of warranty or something, 3 months seems like a short period for it to break."
1,not the best,I tried it but it was not the best for sure. Good graphics but not really realistic. It gets borring after ten min. I suggest renting it before you think about buying it.
1,An insult to all of the great blaxploitation flicks,I grew up in that 70's era of the blaxploitation movies and that did not scratch the surface for me. Sure the clothes the hairstyles and the sets was a good description but the great blaxploitation heroes and heroines fought for serious issues that was going on in the black community and I am very sure it had nothing to do with a presidential conspiracy to shrink the black males genitals either.
1,Truth stood on its head. Disinformation source material,"As an example of what a the intelligence community can produce to undermine the self-determinism of a developing country this would get six stars. As a history book it should rate a minus five for perfect nonsense, but that's not available.Where another intelligence community journalist, Michael Norton (AP) can be described -- in 2000 -- as being a ""pro-Aristide journalist"" you know why Jesse Helms chose this publication for much of his anti-Lavalas vitriol. Lynn Garrison is a Mythomaniac of the first order. Of course he was only doing what he was paid to do, as was Mr. Norton. I was fortunate enough to be able to get this from the ironically named Goodwill Bookstore for a pittance.This particular publication can be held responsible for the violent death of many Haitian martyrs. It's really that toxic."
2,A Mesmerizing and Beautiful Book,"I am a huge fan of Margaret George, I've read every one of her books and have loved them all. I just finished reading Helen of Troy, her latest novel. It was engrossing and haunting. Scenes and phrases are still playing in my mind. I read about 200 pages in a few days and then ended up staying awake all night and finished the book at about 9:00 a.m. I couldn't stop reading, it felt like everything was happening to me and I was completely drawn in.I don't know what else to say except do yourself a favor and get this book. Amazon has amazing savings and I got a brand new hardcover edition for half off the list price, so it was a good bargain as well as a wonderful story. Only one word of warning, you'll definitely want to read the rest of Ms. George's books, so be prepared for a lot of reading in your future!Take care everyone and happy reading."
1,Overly simple,"This is the first translation of The Book of Five Rings that I read. I wasn't terribly impressed with it. After reading the translation by William Scott Wilson, I am even less impressed with Kaufman's translation. While Wilson's may be a bit harder to comprehend on the first read, much is lost in Kaufman's translation in terms of language and metaphor. Kaufman's translation may be better for someone looking for a more simple explanation of technique. However, Wilson's translation offers much more for a reader to wrap his/her mind around. Since I have never read the original text, I can in no way claim to know whose translation is is closer to the original. However for those looking for a more cerebral experience, I would suggest Wilson's translation."
1,I want my money back!!!,"...To tell you the truth I hated this movie, poor light, not good acting, it did't have a good script. My friends and I didn't like it. We were expecting a lot from this movie and we were very dissapointed. If I wasn't that dissapointed I wouldn't be writting this. I just don't want more dissapointed people in the world. It is enough wit me!"
2,Like it!,My kids like this movie and we can see it every so often if we have it in our DVD collection.
1,Back to yelling close the door,"I was so excited to get this product, I put it up as soon as I got and was disappointed. The magnet was not very strong and it took forever to close, a moth flew in the house after the first walk through. You you be better off putting curtain in the doorway. Sent it back the next day :( Sad because it's a great concept."
2,This is a nice cookbook with beautiful photographs,"I just received this book last weekend. I have paged through it several times to decide which recipe to try first. Some of the recipes are unique, some are pure Texas homecooking, but they all sound delicious. The photographs are beautiful. The book contains mostly dessert recipes, but also entrees, drinks, etc. I recommend it to anyone who wants to try a new dessert or add a new book to their collection."
2,"INTERESTING AND SAD! , BUT VERY WELL DONE!","This is very interesting film that is really five stories in one. A dead girl is found and each story is effected by this in one way or another. A great cast and honest dialogue make this one well worth your time. The film is ultimately sad and depressing, but each story is very interesting. With a cast featuring Toni Collette, Giovanni Ribisi, Piper Laurie and many other talents how can you go wrong?"
2,Fine pics,This is a great little camera. The shots are easy to take and view. Great price. Thank you.
1,Come On People!,"Parents this calm after their daughter gets knocked up by some momma's boy......lame and stupid. This film tries to be humerous and fails, tries to be serious and fails and trys to be a film and fails. As one reviwer said ""sassy pregnant teenage girls are so cool""I agree with the negitive reviews. This film is for the sterotypical ""Let's overrate stupid movies people"". This film has a plot and dialogue so stupid it makes my brain hurt. This is alose the garbage that gets nominated for an oscar (anyone who's had to sit threw this film and can string two words together knows what I mean). You wonder how some films get made, or get good reviews when they are complete waste's of film, it's because of those people who love overhyped crappy movies. They will probally demand a sequel or a TV series. I can see it now ""Juno II: Here We Go Again and Juno III: Third Times A Charm ***** two thumbs up amazing! Breath-taking!"" GARBAGE!!!!"
2,Greatest Zeppelin Album,"Many people consider 4 their greatest, but I think it is only because of the radio play and commercial success of that album. Which is fine 4 is an unbelievable album. But, Houses of the Holy shows all of their talents and songwriting ability. It's a rollercoaster ride of an album. I consider it one of the top 5 albums of all time! It's just that good.I have been listening to Zep since I was able to walk and this album get's me just as excited today as when I was in diapers (minus the accidents!)."
1,Fun fluff,"Probably not worth buying on DVD, but as a rental (actually saw it in the theater) it is just fine or as my friend would say: ""fun fluff"".Not being a consumer of the comics, I am not prejudiced to what may or may not have been included in the storyline. As a movie buff, I have to say the effort here was poor to fair. There are just some things that make no sense. Why Alcatraz Island? Why does the winged one escape and only reappear to save his father? Why ARE their so many characters in each film? Why was Halle Barry brought back as Storm, at least in a somewhat pivotal role? Why did the producers even hint that there might be a sequel? Why?!To be honest, I only ever saw the three X-Men films because my friend is an X-Men fan."
1,A dissappointment!,"Frankly I'm quite dissapointed in this film. It's in black and white, which actually is no problem for me since I enjoy classic war films. The dissappointmnet is that the whole movie seems to be shot in a studio!!! and a very small studio! Really dissapointed. Also nothing really special about the story."
2,I don't get some reviews,"Reviewer: Henry, January 30, 2006WROTE""Please read the fine print for ""onecall"" REQUIRES SIGNATURE AT TIME OF DELIVERY !!! this means i'm going to have to take the day off from work or drive 30 miles to pick my package up...""I don't get it.MY GOOD MAN! Had it not occurred to you to have it shipped to your work address?I think it unfair to rate the Onkyo product based on one retailer's shipping policy, (which BTW is designed to protect YOU,) rather than on the quality of the product itself.By the way, did you not see the cost of shipping before buying? If it was too much then why not move on to another internet discount house.In my opinion this is where user reviews break down and become unhelpful."
1,Disappointment,"This yoyo is advertised as auto return. Only auto return if you can use a yoyo, it is simply a string. I feel that the description was misleading. Not recommended for 5 year old."
2,My kids love it!,Keeps them busy for short trips to the store or doctors' office. Not really good for road trips or vacations.
1,Bad Cable - Broke off in projector,"The ends of these cables are thin copper over a plastic stem. We were using for connection of a DVD player to a projector for a classroom. The cable did not work and then we wiggled the cable and got it to work. Then we pulled out the cable from the projector and the thin piece of copper covering the connector broke off inside of the projector. Took almost an hour to get it out. Save tim, stick to solid copper ended connectors!"
1,Way out-of-date,This book targets SQL 6.5. I think it should focus on 7.0. Also SQL 2000 is coming -- it will have even more problems then. I found the material hard to wade through and anachronistic.
2,Golf Anniks's Way,"I am a male that has worked hard mentally, physically and with a golf pro to reduce my high handicap by 10 strokes. The text and photography do a great job of instruction. The transition from the top and backswing as well as iniating the downswing translate into swing improvment. I also liked finding the balls of your feet for balance.I work hard at physical fitness and her chapter Getting Fit was very helpful. Strong to the core on the fitness ball and the med ball twist was great. I am aware of my abs on practice swings for the first time. I recomend this book for a golfer at any level, and believe readers will be suprised at it's quality."
2,Very Nice All-inclusive Unit,"Sony is a brand that demonstrates solid quality all of the time. The DAV-FX900W kept true to that. The unit as some have said does load and change disks slow but overall this would be the only flaw I've seen. Very nice sound, easy installation and fair amount of customizations. For someone who's looking for a nice unit that's easy to use and offers great sound, this is for you."
2,My Style of Blues,"Muddy Waters once said that Johnny Winter was the only white man he ever met who understood the blues. There is something about JW's style that I like. It's the rural and southern type of blues I have always preferred. Unfortunately, his voice is not as strong as it was. As a result, he is slightly flat sometimes. But the arrangements are great and his guitar playing is still solid, albeit slower. Johnny Winter uses a thumbpick and finger pick rather than a flatpick to get a fuller country picking effect. My favorite songs are ""I'm A Blues Man"", ""The Monkey Song"", and ""Let's Start All Over Again."" I know he's getting old but let's not forget that Johnny played for Muddy Waters when he couldn't play as well anymore and Debbie Davies played lead for Albert Collins in his later years. The man still has great taste in music and I'm glad he's around."
1,unbelievably crap quality,"I bought this set really only for the 10mm socket. It did not fit the transmission bolts I needed to remove, since it was manufactured incorrectly. The splines of the triple square profile were not uniformly ground. I looked at the other sizes and saw similar problems on them. Clearly, the slave child in China who made this tool did not get proper nourishment that day/week.Amazon return process was trouble-free, but GearWrench quality control is non-existent. Stay away from any tool with GearWrench name."
2,timex watch,very good watch for this low price. I have bought two of these watches and they both have worked great.
2,This is a MUST HAVE CD!! She is awesome!,"This is one of the best CDs I've listened to in many years. I first heard the song ""everywhere"" in the movie ""American Pie"" and instantly fell in love with it, but the other songs on this CD only get better. My favourite is ""Sweet Misery"" which is the best song I've heard in quite a while. Other standouts include ""Here with me"" and ""Drop in the ocean"", but the whole CD is just incredible. I look forward to her follow-up and hope it's just as spectacular!"
1,Don't even spend the penny to buy it used,"I was a devoted fan of Ms Grimes' Richard Jury series and even wrote to her years ago expressing how much I enjoyed her mysteries. However, something has changed over the past few years. It's as if someone else is writing these books, someone who does not know how to craft an interesting, sensible story that can hold readers' attention. The story moves from quantum mechanics to sentient canines to an ending that leaves one stymied. The writing is what the British might call ""twee,"" just too cute and sickeningly self-absorbed.If you're interested in reading any of Ms Grimes' Richard Jury novels, stick to the early ones. They're first-rate mysteries. This book was my last attempt to find once more the author whose books I loved so much."
1,A Follow-Up Review to My Earlier One,"Okay, now I speak from a little more experience. I have been practicing ""PhotoReading"" regularly since writing the last review, and I can say with confidence that PHOTOREADING IS UTTER NONSENSE. The gimmick, that actual PhotoReading portion of the ""whole mind system"" is a brief, but utter waste of time.Recognize that ALL these ""accelerated learning"" gurus HAVE to come up with some sort of gimmick to distinguish their brand of uselessness from all the others. PhotoReading is Scheele's gimmick. I tried his techniques in one of my graduate classes, and you simply don't get the detail from the text that he claims you do by PhotoReading, and ""dipping and skimming.""No matter what these hucksters promise, there is simply no substitute for hard work."
1,Built to fail,What a piece of junk! I purchased one that ceased to operate after eight months. Then someone gave me a new one as a gift. That lasted for about seven months. I would not recommend this product at all. Maybe this is Creative Labs' attempt to get people to buy more MP3 players.
1,Holes in it,"The cover we received was nice & bright, however ther was a hole in it right out of the box on the orange sun behind Betty's head..I e-mailed you about it & nothing got done...We are all done with ordering from Amazon....thanks"
2,Le Mans,My father had me order this video and he said it was great. Arrived in a short amount of time. Great buy and great supplier.
2,007 fans,i love all 007 movie i have all of them i rally loved every part of this great movie i think 007 rocks
1,Cony dvd player stopped working....,"It won't play dvd's. I can still use the input feature, which is nice for hooking up a game console, and now, a seperate dvd player. I pretty much just use this as a screen now, which is annoying. I paid hard earned money for this. I wanted to be able to use it while traveling. ha not now. amazon shouldn't sell cheap stuff. I want my money back!!"
2,Sturdy product,We love this - it's pretty darn stable (I was afraid it would be easy to topple) and raises our bed to a good height where the dogs can sleep underneath and the A/C vent (right under our bed) has better access to the room.
1,They look prettier than they wear,"Not pleased. I saw them on QVC, but didn't want to pay their high shipping fees. These slippers, although very pretty, didn't fit snuggly as they appear to fit. They were clumsy on my feet and as I walked, they had a mind of their own. I returned immediately. Amazon refunded my money AND paid for the return shipping!"
1,Save your money,I purchased this stain remover with great excitement. When it arrived our housekeeper could not wait to use it as she loves laundry. It does not remove stains as well as the inexpensive stain remover you buy in the grocery store.I called customer service at Black and Decker and what a nightmare. In order to send it back you must send in the cord with $5.00 (can you believe that??) and you will not get a refund but just another one of the Stain Busters. They also wanted my credit card number...unbelievable.I hope to hear from someone who has used it successfully and maybe this one is faulty.
1,Ecco soles fall apart,"Before considering Ecco shoes, just Google ""Ecco soles fall apart""and learn of the many many customers who purchased Ecco shoes, used them occasionally,and experienced sudden disintegration of the soles. Of course, it doesn't happen to every purchaser,but if it does, don't expect that Ecco will help you."
2,Sponges to match the George Foreman grill surface,The shape of this sponge is perfect for the indoor grills and cleans well without scratching. I also have found it to be very durable.
1,FAIL!,"This has got to be the worst purchase I've had in a long time. Inflated ball, hooked it up to hose and then the ball proceeded to fill up with water and sit there like a half deflated lump. Zero fun, Zero excitement. Also, when you open the packaged - the paper instruction book has a huge warning not to return it to the store. What a SCAM!!!!!!!!!! Save your money and don't buy this horrible product!!!!!!!! It just leaves you with sad kids & wasted $."
1,I HATED THIS BOOK!,"I got this book because it was on a list on Amazon of great romance novels. I orderd the book and was very surprised when I read it. The three books didnt seem to match what the back of the book said. The first story took place in 1823! Yet, there was a part when the main character received a phone call. Phones were not invented until later! This I did not like. Then the next book was in 1833 and the last book in 1986. This was honestly the first book I think I have ever NOT finished. I would not recommend it. The language in the first book started out like Old English but, they slowly went into modern day language. It was very offsetting."
2,This book is very good for the fantasy beginner,"As far as I can tell, this is the first book in a series of four written by Rose Estes for Greyhawk Adventures. This was the first fantasy book that I ever read. I would highly recommend this book to those of you that aren't familiar with reading fantasy. It is a good one for beginners. If you've already read the Lord of the Rings or The Wheel of Time, you'll probably think it to be a little less intellectually stimulating. However, this book is a very colorful beginning to an extremely entertaining four book saga."
2,great family fun,My little cousin has watched this tittle 6 times. He knows it line for line. It has a good story line. I will buy this video. Wish it was out on DVD.
1,Dark and dreary,A depressing read about deception in all its forms. Very well written just didn't like the story but at the same time I couldn't put it down because I was hoping for something happy. Weird ending as well.
1,didnt work like i wanted it to,I bought this so i could have an internet connection with both my xbox 360 and my computer. but even though they were both plugged into this only one would have the internet connection. kind of pointless to have 5 ports on this if only one thing is going to keep the internet connection.
1,Only fair...,"This book was only fair at best. It had only a few pictures (mostly of board games and toys) and little worthwhile information. It's basically a collection of the authors' opinions, thoughts, and memories on the topic, which meant little to me since I value my own opinions and memories much more. It's almost like the authors didn't seek, want, and/or have permission to write this book from the people who created the shows they discuss. The authors give us their thoughts instead of the thoughts of the thoughts of those who really matter... the people who created or were involved with the shows. I was hoping for a trip down memory lane; this book took a detour very early on and never got back on track."
2,Great buy,Gift for my husband. Love the smell. Great price too. I would have had to drive an hour away to purchase locally.
1,"NOT BAD, BUT NOT GOOD","After shredding only 10 to 15 documents, this thing will easily overheat and shut off for 15 minutes. I had a stack of documents I wanted to shred, so this made things quite annoying. Otherwise, it's a decent little machine. I recommended avoiding this product though unless you plan on shredding only a few documents at a time."
1,Cd was cracked,"When I received and Got the cd, I was happy, but when I opened it. It was cracked. But got the cd really fast."
1,Junk-,"Purchased two of these for wife and myself. Mine for use with iPhone4 and wife's for iPad. Niether will stay extended, they snap back to stored position. Way too short unless you were to carry iPhone / iPad in your shirt pocket. LOL Impossible to use when they snap back to stowed position, they sound fine if you want to manually keep them extended and chance losing an eye on snap back."
1,overrated!!!,he had one hit in 2003 and nothing else. Remember the macarena? livin la vida loca? feeling hot hot hot? la bamba? sean paul's 15 minutes are DONE! Central American and Island songs become a hit in north america and disappear fast
1,Sad,"The Cure was my favorite band in the 80s. The only thing they made since Wish that's listenable (and that album is mediocre overall) is Bloodflowers. This barely demo quality thing proves the adage ""You can't judge a book by its cover"" wrong, as did Wild Mood Swings.I didn't buy that album because of its cover and its title. When I finally heard it ten years later I found out just how right I was. This one, though, got me, because I was looking for a gift for my sister, a huge Cure fan. I would have been better off buying her a pack of socks.The Cure, though, didn't stop their quest to find the bottom of the bottomless pit with this thing, though. The album after this one is even more preposterous when called a ""Cure"" album. I had suggested that the band get Porl back. I had hoped that would cure them. But, the problem must really be Robert. He has utterly lost it and needs to pack it in."
2,Today's Best Ska/Rocksteady/Reggae,"Absolutely excellent. With Hepcat slipping away, the slackers are now the best hope for modern ska we have left, and they are totally equipped to live up to that title. ""Wasted Days"", the band's fifth album, is just another picture of how brilliant they actually are. On this album, all the bands trademarks are here: Vic's great song writing, dave's arrangements, mark's gospel-party like vocals, and the smoothest rhythm and horns section out there. The band also explores new territory here, using many dub and remixing techniques on a few of the songs.Helping out with the record's production is none other than legendary Upsetters organist Glen Adams. Unfortunately, amazon doesnt carry this album's vinyl counterpart, which features different mixes of a few songs, and also a few songs that arent even on the cd version! It also doesnt repeat any tracks from the cd with the exception of the title track."
2,Gary is underrated as a singer.,"Gary can sing anything in all ranges. If you are a Cherone fan, then I would recommend it. If you are looking for that Extreme or Van Halen sound, then this is not it. Sorry!"
2,A great deal on a great connection,"I use this to connect an iMac to a stereo system. The sound quality is excellent, easily worth more than the small price tag."
2,Awsome DVD 2 Thumbs up.,I love quartet music & this is another great one. If anyone Likes quartets they should pick this one up. They won't be sorry.
1,Ghostbusters III (be warned - SPOILERS AHEAD),"Here's a point by point analysis of Ivan Reitman's latest insult to the intelligence of movie-goers everywhere:GHOSTBUSTERS / EVOLUTION1. 3 white guys and 1 black guy / 3 men and 1 woman2.

2,SLEEPER NO YAWNER,"Steven Harriman (aka Steven Spruill) has written a tight, original and suspenseful thriller in SLEEPER. Although there are a couple of lengthy sequences that tend to distract the reader, he provides us with some three-dimensional characters that one can identify and empathize with: Dr. Andrea DeLuca, a brilliant herpetologist, more involved in the creature's background than she can imagine; Ed Jeffers, a conscientious and loyal member of the Pentagon, whose own disability haunts his life; and the macho Terrill Hodge, the SEALS commander with an agenda of his own.Harriman blends these personal crises into the horror of the story very well, and there are several scenes of bloodcurdling terror. This novel isn't as good as Matt Reilly's action books or as exciting as ""Jinn"", but it is a good read and would like to see more of Harriman in the future."
1,It was such a let down...,"Amerika Jones has a beautiful voice but its wasted on her renditions of the dialect poems...as typical of most Dunbar orators I have heard the dialect is delivered in the most stiff, over or un-dramatic styles...its terrible whats out their, I wanted this tape to be wonderful...I love and have a deep respect for his works... but this production does no justice to the beauty of his words. Audio tape of Dunbars dialect poetry, are available if you would like to hear the ""character"" in his poems and not the ""Amos and Andy caricature""..."
2,great when it works,"The first TWO unit i bought doesn't work. I got blanking red lights. The 3rd was a charm. Now with xbox live, it's great. I got Forza 2, DiRT, Gears of War, Ultimate Alliance. Graphics are great. The best HD video source u can get. In contrast, Comcast HD looks just okay, but downloaded video clips look great. Too bad it can't play HDDVD without buying another device. You almost don't have to buy cames. There are demos to download all the time. It's great to have a bunch of demos and a few arcade games when friends come by."
2,It shows you the picture on the box,"Many books give you the pieces of the puzzle, but Jacquie Barker's Beginning Java Objects shows you the picture on the box. If you want to learn Java, this is the book you should read first."
2,Remember when people made great ALBUMS?,"If you do - you'll love Writer's Block. If you don't, you need to check this album out. It's got a very 1970's singer-songwriter vibe to it, but it doesn't sound dated. More like timeless. Great originals, groovy covers and inventive medleys (dig Some Kind Of Wonderful/Night Ride Home). Really nice stuff."
2,Amazing head trip,"I never thought I'd see myself writing these words, but this business book seriously changed my life. One other reviewer stated that he read the book multiple times, and I took the same approach with the following result:First time: I didn't get it. Richard uses a lot of jargon and has some very far out concepts. His ideas are sound but his approach is eccentric, which make me realize I definitely needed to spend more time on it.Second time: I was getting it. Not quite, but the jargon made sense and the ideas were locking together in my head.Third time: I not only got it, but was reading each section in the context of the whole, with which I was now familiar with.Fourth time: I not only got it and saw the whole picture, but was now applying the concepts to my own world.I haven't read the book for almost seven years and I still use it every day. Reading and applying it was a most rewarding experience, to say the very least."
1,Clearly dissappointing,I looked forward to reading this book and couldn't wait to get into the story. Very flat & uninspiring to say the least. It really didn't move me and the author missed the mark on this one.Smitty's Cave Adventures
1,Bunn Coffee Maker,"I am very disappointed in the item that I received. I have ordered from Amazon before and never had a problem. I ordered this NEW Bunn Coffee Maker to give as a gift and must have received a used one. Within a week of use the coffee maker showed signs of being totally limed up. Instead of a new coffee maker, I must have received a used one. I will be sending it back for a refund."
1,...,"This is the first time i bought a ja rule cd, and it will definitely be my last. i bought cuz i know it had some songs i liked like ""living it up"", ""im real"" and ""always on time"" from the radio. thing is, pretty much every other song on the cd is ..., all filler songs clearly put in just so there would be enough tracks (smokin and ridin should not fall under the category of a song it is so bad). some of the hits i mentioned above are good, but the cd as a whole is terrible and just shows how greedy an artist can be."
2,the review of the people,this cd is relly different and the songs get stuck in your head not only that but its cheap too they should really have more solos by kelsey
1,What Garbage!!!,"Well, Quicken forced me to switch from my version of 2002 by switching dl protocol with the banks... so I did, but what garbage!! Resource hog always checks in with Intuit site... I don't trust it at all. I've use quicken products for about 15 years, but I'm looking to switch."
2,Dave Seaman is Incredible,Dave Seaman's mixes are absolutely brilliant. Great track selection and awesome mixing. Ian Ossia is not in the same league but the collection is a must-buy for the Dave Seaman disks. Also check out his superb Renaissance America disk.
1,Warning: So weird had to walk away,"Not sure how to rate this movie. It was just so, well, 'bad' overall that I had to leave. Weird or odd are better words yet they are not enough. The whole premise is very offensive to history but I'm cool with that if the movie is entertaining. This move is not entertaining. It's dance-fighting mixed with vampires, 2 genres tailored to women. I swear I'm tired of movies that only one sex can watch. Back in the day action movies were enjoyed by men and women now we get crap like this and women are just thrilled about it.By the way horrible all around, directing, plot, acting, fight scenes. I recall girl cousin bragging how there were 2 guys fighting literally on each other. Ick. Apparently vampires can make gravity go away, I don't know I'm not into Twilight and True Blood plus whatever else is out there. Just weird movie all together, when you watch it put your brain somewhere else for safe keeping to prevent damage."
2,Very Nice Slipper,"I ordered these slippers for my husband for Christmas this year. He asked for one thing and that was a nice pair of indoor/outdoor slippers. When they arrived, I opened the box and was very pleased. My husband is pretty picky and he really, really likes them. He said they are made very well, they are very warm, and made to last. I would definitely recommend them!"
1,We used to call this a garage band,"I don't get it! This is not a tribute unless you call a garage band, who tries to copy Heart a Heart tribute. The problem is why? Buy the real thing! I'm a singer and I believe a pretty good one, but there is no way I would ever copy Ann Wilson. You can't and get any positive feedback. Any singer knows that. Again, my opinion and question WHY??? Save your money folks and buy the real thing not a copy band. Sorry copy band come up with originals."
1,All the same color pieces,Everything was fine if I didn't want to play chess. The board was fine and the pieces were fine but they were all brown. Didn't send any white pieces. Waiting to see if the seller is going to send white pieces or I have to return the whole thing.
2,So cool,"Last time I opened basketball card packs I was like 14 years old. And now 17 years later, I felt like a kid again. I remember I loved to open packs, and the sensation of not knowing what you gonna get its really great. Actually I got really cool cards, some of them Michael Jordan's."
1,18/0 stainless steel NOT 18/10 --- save your money!,"Product is described as 18/10 stainless steel. I bought it based on this description. When I received the item I looked carefully at the box and it says nothing about it's grade. I opened the box and looked at the bottom of the pan--no marking. I called Kitchen Aid, gave them the product name and item number on the box and they told me the item is 18/0 ZERO--not 18/10--there's no nickel in the item at all. The higher the nickel content the higher the protection from corrosion. These are going back."
1,More than lesser Baldacci,"I'll sum it up real fast:1. too many characters2. too many plots3. not enough focus (writing not tight)4. unsatisfying endI loved earlier Baldacci novels, somewhat like DeMille, but this one was basically churned out. Get a large easel and marker ready so you can diagram all of the characters...really."
2,amazing,"Christina was hot and it is so high energy. I loved the whole thing, what a great concert. I haven't even gotten to to the behind the scenese because I can't stop watching the concert. (great for watching it while on a treadmill)"
1,SICK TWISTED SEXIST,"DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!! EVER!!!!!NO NO NO . This man is terrible. He only believes in covens, thinks you have to tie up someone naked with a blind fold to initiate them, believes you have to have a priest and priestess... and the priest is the Boss, and the only true way is his, otherwise you are doing it wrong. I've only read the book I did'nt buy it Thank Goddess!!!!! This man has no right to call himself a witch, he is sick."
2,catches fleas,"Well, it catches fleas pretty well. Not all of them though. I recommend it, as one of the things to do/buy if you're waging war against fleas!Originally ordered two as a precaution after flogging the house. (failed attempt)And the fleas starting showing up on these traps!We have not been able to get rid of those darn fleas, so I will be trying other floggers, and bathing my cat with natural remedies, along with my recent purchase of 2 more traps!Fleas don't like sweet smelling stuff, so I've been spraying my ankles and feet with an old perfume I don't use, and it seems to be keeping them off. My house is mostly carpet though =/"
2,Gets me moving!,"I'm over 60, and very much of a computer potato. The Wii (with the Sports bundle) gets me off the computer (for a while every day, anyway!) and gets me moving! Bowling is the most fun sport for me. I also bought the Wii Fit to go with it. It's helping me with my overall strength, as well as body balance issues. It's even helping my overweight husband. There is a great variety of games to choose from, so that even when I'm feeling not-so-good on any given day, I can choose lower-energy games (exercises.) I have zero complaints! I love it, and can't imagine ever ""outgrowing"" it or getting bored with it!"
2,Don't leave home without them.,"Paranoia set in my 1st time I parked my vehicle at a remote trail head with a cargo hitch platform folded up. Great item. Readily attaches and easy to detach, which means 1-2 minutes to pull a couple of pins, flopped into a pick-up truck and be gone. I guess it takes a thief to recognize a thief's opportunity. Enough said, these pins lock and unlock with a key, making it almost impossible to remove from Tow hitch. I now have no paranoia and enjoy taking hikes knowing everything is secure. Rubber caps also help prevent weathering in wet (rain & snow) conditions."
1,Very Poor Accuracy - 500 Calories for Yoga??,"I was very please with my HRM watch and chest strap, until I used the review feature where I learned htat the calorie counter was way off. It calculates your calories burned with only 2 pieces of information; heart rate and weight. As much as I would love to believe that I am burning close to 500 calories while doing 50 minutes of yoga, I just can't deal with it's gross inaccuracy. Very disappointed in Timex products. I think that I will try to get a refund, and the invest in a higher quality HRM watch."
1,Too much plain english,"Yes, the book explains C++ in plain English. A LOT of plain english. Too much for my liking. There was so much unrelated wordage in there that the on-topic writing got thrown at you without reasonable explanation. There is little reference to how to use a command, only an overdose of why.While reading the book, I attempted to write simple C++ programs based on what was being covered, most of which failed miserably. When I re-read the related material again, I still found no hope of learning what I was doing wrong. Even after typing code exactly as it comes out of the book, it still did not work.If you want to learn C++ don't read this book. It will leave you more confused after reading it than you were before you picked it up."
2,The best batteries I've bought yet,"These batteries are worth the 100% premium on price you pay.On my Olympus C-2100, I'm still using a set I charged up three months ago, have taken about 50 pictures with flash around the house for various things. My normal rechargeables would have been long dead. My battery icon still says full.It's been so long since I've charged them, I can't find the charger."
2,A Classic from an Early Hippie Band,"The themes of the songs may seem dated to younger listeners, but this album still holds up as the music is fun, interesting and excellent. This was one of the first Hippie bands, and therefore may sound super-outdated to young listeners today, but give it a chance; you won't be sorry. The vocals from these guys are always interesting and enjoyable, even downright beautiful. They are quirky and wonderful, as is this CD."
1,"Memeory corruption due to the card, not the camera",I am using a this card with a brand new Canon S400. Every 1 out of ~6 pictures will be corrupted. My friend has the same card and the same camera as mine but has no problems at all. Therefore I think the card is defective and I will be replacing it by calling Viking.
1,I ordered for Catch A Falling Star on 4/26 & haven't rec'd,I ordered & paid for Catch A Falling Star on 4/26 through Paypal. I've e'd the seller a few times with no results! I won't deal through him again.
2,Terribly Underrated,"This pretty much has it all: Cooper, beautiful women, great character actors, magnificent action scenes, splended scenery, and wonderful photography. In short, it's well worth watching. A fun film to see, and Preston is always great, as is Cooper. A terrific movie dealing with loyalty and the consequences of betrayal. Included in the book 'Head `Em Off At the Pass! 94 Westerns You Should Watch.'Head `Em Off At the Pass!: 94 Westerns You Should Watch"
1,Disappointing characters,"This was my first BP book, and I found Gail Connor to be rather unlikable. She alternates between over-protecting and neglecting her daughter, uses people to get what she wants, takes drugs when she gets overwhelmed at work, and justifies stealing based on who's more deserving. Her client often acted like a jerk, so I found it hard to care who won.Most of the secondary characters were likable - I found it hard to believe they cared so much about Gail.I'd recommend any of Robert Parker's books over this - his characters are honest, intelligent and clever, and the relationships are believable."
2,Awesome CD!!!,This cd is so Great! I am very happy I bought it! I can listen to it over and over and never get tired of the music! Awesome soundtrack to go with an awesome film!
2,Provides some solid footing in an unpredictable world.,"The authors profile and give guidelines to the design of a business that can capitalize on the unpredictable; a kinetic enterprise moves, instantly, responding to new demands and seizing new opportunities. The enterprise is organized around workers who initiate and execute unpredictable projects (""events"") driven by market opportunities and customer demands. This work focuses on leadership, an empowered work force, infrastructure, and market and customer events. The book offers numerous examples that illustrate its central theme.If you are searching for some certainty in this today's chaos, this book provides some solid footing in an unpredictable world.

1,"Enthusiastic, but not scripturally sound","I'm not a Pentacostal, but I attend a Spirit-filled bible study (which I enjoy) where I was lent this book. The author insists many times that every believer can have all the spiritual gifts, contrary to scripture. He plays fast and loose with his interpretation of scripture. His categorizations of the gifts also seem somewhat arbitrary, and he leaves out gifts such as teaching and apostleship. I'm open to the spiritual gifts continuing today, but it's in spite of Les Sumrall's arguments, not because of them."
2,Mother's of All Ages,"I am a new mommy, and I have been so lost in my kids life that I forgot my own!! this book is such an empowerment for Mother's of all ages!I love the writing style and how cute it is! I also just bought a Hot Mom's TSHIRT!!!this book is amazing-- when's the sequel coming out?"
2,Re-live your youth!,"Good to see this series is just as entertaining as I remember from when I was younger! And to see what I remember as 'the ideal wife and mother' really was, even if by virtue of the script-writing. Certainly very good value and entertainment at the price for so many episodes."
1,was broken,"bought it to use at burning man and was looking forward to it, but when i popped batteries in there it never worked. very disappointed."
1,THIS IS A TERRIBLE ALBUM,"if you're considering buying this album i'd say you'd probably enjoy it, but if you have any respect for yourself and the people around you please forget it and buy something less terrible."
1,NO GOOD,Waste of my money!!!! first it took longer than usual to ship than when i got it the nail polish seemed used when i order new because the top was dried out already on top of that it wouldn't shatter i thought maybe i applied it wrong but i tried the black shatter n it worked perfectly i've used the black shatter before never a problem but this one seemed water downed nail polish.
1,SKIP THIS BOOK!,"Really terrible first novel, trying to continue reading it gave me a headache.I recommend you read ""ALONE"" followed by ""HIDE"" and not waste your time on this.By the way, there is no such time as ""oh seven hundred thirty"". The correct terminology would be ""zero seven thirty hours"". This mistake is repeated and very annoying"
2,IT WAS GOOD,IT WAS GOOD AND IT WORKS WELL. IT SIMPLE TO USE EVERYONE. ALSO IT WAS PERFECT FOR BUSY PEOPLE.
1,check your shipping,The shipping cost me 3x the package and it was hard to determine this with other bigger purchases involved. Defifnitely you can find this cheaper elsewhere
1,"I never got it,","I waited for this but I never received it. I sent two emails. They replied to the first one. Still waiting on the second response I sent last week. They wanted to verify my address (which it was correct except for the postal code that I couldn't verify). I checked my mail every day. I paid about 6 dollars for the screen protector so I probably don't mean much to them but I think they can do a better job for all customers including their ""small"" ones. This is my first experience with them. I hate to pay for something and get nothing in return."
1,Mindless revenge flick that goes nowhere slowly,"Don't make the mistake of renting this video (like I did), you'll be sorry. The plot is so basic my 2 year old daughter could come up with something better. Here it is in a nutshell: bad guys kill the sister of this guy who has a bad hairdo and wardrobe (Heavener), he hunts them down and kills them... I kept waiting for something interesting or surprising but there was nothing. The action scenes were filmed really bad, which made things even worse. Very low budget video with bad sound and lighting."
1,Underwhelmed,"I read this book for a book club. If I read it for myself, I would have stopped at page 50 or so. BTW, no one could finish it in the book club...I was the only one who read the entire book."
1,Kindle Version Unusable,"Having read so many great things about this book, I was very excited to get into it and really get working on verbs. I was also looking forward to being able to cart it around with all my other books via my Kindle.Unfortunately, like so many other language books, this one is not ported well. In fact, I would have to say it's worse than many others, as the tables are put together in image files which are too small to read, even when expanded.I'm still waiting for a publisher of this type of book to get serious about the Kindle and really translate their work over to a format that the reader can use."
2,open season,"I GOT THIS GAME DECEMBER 31 2006 AND LET ME TELL YOU THIS GAME IS REALY GOOD. YOU GET TO PLAY AS BOOG AND ELLIOT.

1,Not recommended,"Regrettably Gardiner's latest offering ""History of the White Star Line"" is little more than a poorly written chronology of largely disconnected events in the history of the famous shipping company. While apparently factual (in contrast to his earlier ""Titanic Conspiracy"" which suggested that Titanic had been secretly switched with her sister ship and intentionally sunk) I found ""History of the White Star Line"" to be a largely unreadable assembly of historical tidbits which seem as if a collection of unrelated newspaper clippings had been bound together and covered with a dust wrapper. His research seems to be adequate, however style and editing are largely nonexistent."
2,Great shoe,"These are the most comfortable shoes I have. In fact they are so comfortable, I bought an other pair!"
2,Very nice collection,"This book has a large variety of prayers for all occasions. It's nice and small, but has large text so it's easy for little ones learning to read. The prayers are illustrated with appropriate and easy to depict images. I definitely prefer this book to the ""Baby's First Bible"" by the same author. It would make a very nice gift for a toddler or preschooler for Christmas, Easter, or other religious holiday."
1,Don't Buy It,I am disturbed that Amazon would even sell this book. Doesn't anyone in the marketing or administrative offices at Amazon READ THOROUGHLY the books that are published and for sale. I will not buy anything from Amazon as long as this book is for sale on the site.
2,Works,Not too much to review... It absorbs sound at it is supposed to. Good material... Just don't let a dog pee on it cause the stink cannot be removed and your studio will really smell... lol
2,So glad I upgraded!,"I could not be happier with the new phone I got. I had the I530 (construction phone) and decided I needed an upgrade. The I530 was great, but just too bulky for my liking. As for the I850-The menu is very easy to navigate (if you have been a Nextel user) and ring/DC is very loud. My reception is good but I do get some dropped calls...living in rural Colorado will do that I would DEFINITELY recommend this phone. The battery life is NORMAL. People say ""oh the battery life is horrible"" but isn't it on every phone? We all want to talk for 2 hours on a phone...but cell phones just don't do it. Good luck!"
2,Coleman 12 cup coffee pot,I really like this coffee pot and would buy it again or recommend it to other people. I did not give it five stars because there are no cup markings and the handle is not solid so it does not feel secure when the pot is full.
1,Amatuerish writing by an egomaniac with little to say.,"I was initially shocked at the large point font. Later I realized that this was necessitated by the author's lack of writing or observational skills.The story starts strongly, but then wimpers out. He concentrates on the soap opera aspects of the climbing team while ignoring the human versus mountain drama.An annoying, frustrating little book after reading ""Into Thin Air"", ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Endurance"".Look at the cover, then don't bother further with this one."
2,DYNOMITE!!!!!!!!!!,"with out question the best recording ever put on disc,the music is timeless.i saw them in winston-salem,n.c. back in 70 blew me away ,still can see them on stage today.if givin only five albums to have to listen to for ever this would be top of my list!! one of a kind!! if you donot own this one you dont love great music.every one should have this in their collection!!! a must"
1,very poor shaver,"I bought this razor on consumer report recommendation, now i really doubt consumer reports. this foil razor cannot cut a one day growth at all. it is a very time consuming razor,its only plus is the trimmer, which i have to use first to cut close enough to shave, and i do not have heavy whiskers. I am staying with my old remmington titanium r 846 9 years old never changed the blades and still shaves my entire face in a minute or two with out effort. i wont be foiled again."
2,Love this album,"I never grow tired of this album.My favorites are Lex, loud pipes, wildcat and norstrand, but every time I re-listen to the album another song grows on me."
2,great for tracing patterns!,"i love this for tracing patterns and also for transferring pattern marks onto fabric! it works really well and does exactly what it says. i wish they made this in bigger sheets, but really, it's fine as you can of course lay them out next to each other. each sheet can also handle several uses, even when it looks like it's been used up. will definitely get more when i run out!"
1,Disgusting!,"This book was totally awful. It deserves a negative one hundred stars. I can't believe Oprah would endorse such a book. I got about half way through this book and decided to put this filth down and not to fill my mind with such trash. I would be embarassed to be able to think of such terrible things, much less be able write a whole book filled with it. Avoid this book at all costs."
1,this whip had no crack!,"Satan's Whip. Just a few words about this movie. It was very slow moving, very low budget, and just not very good at all. The salty old priest provided a bit of amusement, but basically it wasn't very well written or interesting. I am a fan of low budget and have seen alot of gems, however this is not one of them."
2,Good intermediate text,This seems like a good intermediate text. I wish that it came with audio and video components as they would be very helpful to students.
1,Not even close,"I purchased this book to use as a study guide for the NYS CST in French. I have taken this test before, and unfortunatley did not pass the first time. First of all, the test is completely in French. This review guide offers all questions in English. Even worse than that, there are major grammatical errors and I found at least five answers in the Key to be incorrect, as a matter of fact, the correct responses were not even offered for several questions. I now feel as if I have worsened my knowledge by studying incorrect information."
2,i liked it...just sayin,"Funny clever hipster flick. It's basically a satire of the people who would want to watch it. I had seen it before, but I got it from here as a birthday gift for my brother, who is even more of a hipster snob than I am."
2,present for son-in-law,This item was a Christmas present for my son-in-law. He was excited to get it and he has told me that is works excellent!!
1,These used to be so GOOD,These used to be so good and I used to buy them by the bunch but ever since they switched from Aspartame to Sucralose they are the grossest most disgusting thing out there. Nevermind I hate the taste of Sucralose But I am one of the few I guess where Sucralose makes me violently ill. The Wintergreen ones still are amazing though because they are using Aspartame still but I don't see that lasting very long. Almost every sugar free product is switching to Sucralose.
2,A poor recording of wonderful music played near perfectly.,"Recoreded in 46', this disc has many cracks, snaps and pops which are a little bit annoying, but the musicianship on the disc is amazing. It contains a wonderful selection of pieces ranging from sad and romantic to fast and virtuosic. Milstein is a phenomenal violinist and this recording captures him at his best. This record is a must have for violin fan fans as well as anyone with a pulse.5 stars even though the recording is bad."
1,Bummed out!,"Godspell is a 5 star musical, don't get me wrong - I was, however, under the impression that this book would have renditions of the new revival musical (as the preview cites ""new transcriptions approved by Stephen Schwartz...). Instead, it is the very same Godspell p/v/g music originally put out in 1971, with the exception of ""Beautiful City"" (which I found on musicnotes.com three months ago). I'm so bummed I can hardly stand it - just spent money on music I already had."
2,MV50 Superflow Pump,"I have tried several low priced compressors for use as inflating the tires on my Ford F350. Most of them either take forever or simply cannot handle the pressure. I have even burned several of them out. The MV50, however, is strong and fast and easily up to the task. There are only two drawbacks: The unconventional tire inflator fitting on the end of the hose can be difficult to use depending on wheel configuration. I would have preferred a more traditional fitting, especially with a reverse ""truck chuck"" on it. The only other problem is the cord is too short. This unit must be attached to your vehicle's battery and the cord will not permit inflation of the rear tires on my F350 crew cab with the 8 foot bed. that being said, its easy enough to just hook up jumper cables to bridge that gap, plus most vehicles are not as long as mine anyway. All in all, this is a great product at a good price."
1,Good content trapped in a bad wrapping,"Not very impressed. The characters are in a weird font like it's copied with low resolution - you can see the pixels in the Chinese characters.I can't say that I'm impressed. Not at all. I opened the book when I got it, and read a bit, but because of the bad quality of the binding (they print this booklet AFTER you have ordered it). But the paper quality is good, and so is the content of the text. Though, I don't think I will ever use this book. I don't feel that this purchase was worth it at all - there must be much better versions of this out there ... somewhere, I hope.Should include pinyin transcription too!"
1,Who thought the yarn was a good idea?,"This machine is good idea, but in reality it is not that well made. The wheel stops turning constantly. Since Christmas my granddaughter has only been able to work on it for 15 minutes. The eyelash yarn is awful. It tangles in the skein and in the machine. It is also almost impossible to bind the tube off of the machine with that yarn. When I bought it I could not see the eyelash yarn in the box, or I would have known to buy another yarn to go with it. The other thing that should have been listed on the box, is that it takes a lace weight or at the most a sock weight yarn. I am waiting to get some different yarn before my final decision, but I am disappointed in it."
2,Only conventional small TV on the market.,"With the advent of HD and wide TV's dominating the market it is just about impossible to find such a small TV.I found the product good. It has a nice picture, however you must watch it at the proper angle otherwise the picture is hard to see. This is the same problem as with many LCD monitors. I only used it with cable input, cannot comment on reception via its own tuner. I have not used it with auxiliary input (i.e. DVD player) so can't comment on that either.The remote had a problem with some of the keys being dead. I had to deal directly with the manufacturer to get it replaced. The new one is O.K.I think it is a good value for the price, although I did prefer my old Sony tube set until it went up in smoke."
2,Jewish woman's personal discoveries living life on Indian Ti,"These ""adventures"" of this phobic, anxiety-ridden, Jewish woman and her husband (who is constantly making the best of some of the strangest situations his wife and he get into). Even moreso the changes that begin to occur in her life as she begins an exploration and infact learns to embrace much of the culture of the Native Americans of the Southwest, and how it ultimately leads her to understand her own Jewish culture through it. Constantly ranging from hilarious to touching. A special read for wom"
2,greatest funniest game ever,great graphics great for partys and everything i would get this game at a differnt store like circuit city but its a sweet game
1,TRICKY! TRICKY! TRICKY!,THIS CD IS VERY DECEIVING. I ALSO BOUGHT THIS CD FOR ONE SONG AND AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE A REASON THAT THIS CD WAS SO CHEAP. AS SOON AS I REALISED WHAT THIS CD REALLY WAS I PUT THIS CD AWAY. I WILL NEVER LISTEN TO IT AGAIN. A TRUE WASTE OF MONEY.
2,More Harmony books...PLEASE!!,"Jayne Ann has been doing trilogies - cranking out three books for a set of characters, and outside her Eclipse Bay, the first one is so good, second two suck! REALLY.However, it's with her Harmony books Jayne Ann really returns to her top form. They are fresh, funny and show she still have the magic. So STOP WASTING TIME ON JUNK and write were you show the same spark of romance and delight in the genre.PLEASE. These characters were so warm, real, sexy and loving. What you other books are missing."
2,Must have for people with back problems,"I've been using these sorts of cushions for maybe 10 years. I haven't noticed one brand to be any different from another, so I usually go with the cheapest. My only problem is that, if you're heavy, they flatten out. But they still serve the purpose of relieving the pressure on your coccyx."
1,I'll stick with Sookie,"Easy and quick read, but a very predictable plot. Was hoping for more twists but I guess that I will just have to wait until summer for the next Sookie book!"
1,A waste of money,"I found this book to be atrocious. Completely useless, provided you have a copy of the manual Borland (Inprise) provide with JBuilder. In fact, most of the examples in the text seem to have been taken directly from the JBuilder's JavaDoc files! I learned much more about JBuilder by following along with Borland's tutorials than be reading ""Teach yourself Jbuilder..."". My advice: read the manual to learn about JBuilder's idiosyncracies, and spend your book money on ""Object Oriented Design in Java"" by Gilbert and McCarty."
1,Toilet Seat,"I ordered 2 white toilet seats, both had slightly different connectors and both seats slide sideways even after retightening the plastic tension nuts. I do not recommend these. I'm sorry I purchased them as they dont stay very well. I thought with the metal attachment bolts they would hold and not move side to side. There should have been better attachment hardware. Update 3-20-09, both seats have broken. On one the plastic bumper under the seat broke and the other totally cracked. The price can easily be beat at Lowes or the Home Depot. I just bought a better fitting seat for 20 dollars."
2,This was so funny,"I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute, original story and all the actors were great. Clive Owen (who was in Croupier last year) was especially good - he is going to be a big star. This is a movie for everyone who loved Saving Grace and Waking Ned Devine."
1,cute toy,"I had one whenever I was a kid, and I loved it. I recently ordered this doll for my sister."
2,Excellent insight,"This book gave me an excellent insight into one of the important aspects of yacht racing: your own psyche. Why do the same people tend to win over and over again, while others tends to loose time after time? Learn to be honest to yourself, face your faults and learn how to correct them."
2,"Strong, but has vibrations","Very well made. A bargin for the price. I have seen really expensive ones that are not so good. Great on low speed, but on the high speed setting, my hand starts to feel the vibrations from the massager."
2,IPOD touch and secured network,"I rec'd a DIR 655 router yesterday and was unable to connect with my IPOD using a secured network. I called customer service and they eventually told me the IPOD would not work with WEP or WPA security settings. It worked with no security enabled.After some pondering, I changed the security settings to WPA Personal on the dlink router page: [...] and was able to log onto my now secured network with the IPOD without problem. Customer service was wrong and lacked basic information on the appropriate security setting.The claim of 6 times greater range seems specious. I had an old Dlink VPN router which did not reach my basement or the other side of my house (1st floor) from the 2nd floor. This one seems to have about the same range (and bars) notwithstanding boasts to the contrary. It is faster, particularly with a direct plug-in connection. I will still need an extender which I hoped to do without."
2,Early Libra is HOT!,Early Libra sung by Kamal on this album is a hot track that still gets airplay. Anyone who thinks it's dross should look at themselves in the mirror. Ha!
1,"Paid for new received used,","I ordered this book mainly to bring my order over $25. I paid for a new book but received a used one. Customer service kindly refunded the charge. I was pleased with their prompt response. The book itself is not as cute as I expected based on description,"
1,Wrong product,I thought I was ordering White Linen. When it arrived it was White Linen Breeze. I had to return it.
1,Avoid!,"From the tacky cover photo, to the embarrassingly awful ""Baby I'm Burning,"" this album ranks as perhaps the absolute nadir of Parton's career. Dolly herself has admitted that she had to record music she didn't really like in order to make a living, but there is absolutely no reason why anyone needs to be reminded of this today. To be avoided at all costs."
1,It is an obscure training guide,"This book was of no use to me. It is difficult to follow, it does not provide an easy way to figure out what do you need to do for all the sections required in an APA style paper. And then if you had the time to do what this book say you first would have do a ""test"" on what you know. And then ""attempt"" to use this book to craft your own paper is another challenge. Maybe this books needs another book to explain its use. I found that it is easier to use the APA manual itself.I would not buy this book if I had another chance."
1,Voice Track Redone,"My wife LOVES Carly Simon, and especially the Vineyard Concert from some 20 years ago. I taped this concert live off of HBO when it was aired originally, and we have almost worn the VHS tape out, playing it dozens of times. I bought this VHS tape as a backup, figuring my original would wear out sooner or later.Well, it's the same... almost.Any buyer should beware that the entire lead vocal track has been redone. To some, this may be an improvement; after all, the lead vocals are now absolutely perfect. But I like the energy from the original, and knowing that my tape was exactly how she sounded THAT NIGHT. And she sounded terrific - it really wasn't necessary to re-do the vocals. It kind of reduces the show to a lip-synching exercise. Maybe that makes me a purist. But a concert should stay a concert, in my opinion, with the original live vocals."
1,"Tough mat workout, but instructor doesn't give any cues.","I have done alot of workout DVDs, and this one is definitely tough - especially the arm workout. However, as some of the other reviews mention, there are literally no cues or explanations of how to properly do the exercises. This makes it difficult to follow which ultimately reduces the effectiveness of the workout and is very frustrating.I also think it is unrealistic that in her interview she states ""she really doesn't want you doing anything else"" besides her mat and cardio workouts."
1,"""Prey"" for this one","I have read every Prey book. Unfortunately Easy Prey is a disappointment. I am committed to finish every book I start but this was hard. Lucas Davenport was out of his element. He was having sex with a bisexual woman who also had a previous relationship with her brother, lusting after an old flame from college and still bumping into Weather. Lucas is a womanizer but this was pretty far fetched. The plot was hard to follow. There should gave been much more looking into the killer's mind. That is the great part of previous Prey books. I read another review that said this one was written on autopilot (like the house payment was due and he needed some coin). I am sure his new Prey book will return him to excellence."
2,one word - Transcendant,"This collaboration of Jobim and Sinatra is exquisitely understated. Jobim, a genius in his own right, masterfully creates a perfect backdrop for Sinatra. We are allowed to see, hear and feel the inner man behind the legend and hype. A tour de force of technical prowess, coupled with an emotional vulnerability that touches a very deep chord. Buy it!"
1,Bought for Mercedes,I thought these looked like decent rock guards. I'll probably give these away if anyone will even take them. I'll be buying something off the self from a department or auto parts store for less money that will be more durable.
1,OFF SEASON,The premise of man hunting man has been around since THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. SEASON OF THE HUNTED doesn't add anything new to this scenario nor is it especially well done.The fade out direction wears thin and exposes the sloppy editing. The movie looks grainy; the background music is annoying and obtrusive. Usually reliable Muse Watson (recently a semi-regular on NCIS) is a victim of the poorly conceived script; the rest of the cast just can't act. The gore is obviously fake.SEASON OF THE HUNTED is not worth your time.
1,I don't get it...,"So many reviewers loved this book, but I just don't see why. I really looked forward to reading it because, like the main character, I am 27 and overweight. However, it just didn't seem that believable. I just find it hard to believe that the woman who was deathly afraid of shopping at Lane Bryant by herself because she might be seen and taunted could become the ""poster child for overweight women everywhere"" on a national weight loss reality TV show. Isn't that a bit of a contridiction? Rather than find Kat endearing, I found her annoying and not all that funny. Maybe it was just me, but this book seemed mediocre at best."
2,Love Some MacGyver,"I haven't opened this yet, but I love MacGyver, always have and always will. I definitely recommend this series to anyone that loves adventure, mixed with a little comedy."
2,Bigger than what I expected,"The pockets are a little loose than I'd hoped, but this isn't for me but for my fiance. hopefully, he'll like it."
1,generic film,"this film is aight. it had some laughs. I was up late over the weekend just Moting with the channels&I needed to laugh before I went to sleep so i flipped this film on&got a few laughs.it was very predictable,but it had some cool moments. that Crib was tight. the Chicks were banging&there was some funny moments,but on a whole it was very generic&just kinda there."
1,About The B'nai Bagels,"The book wasn' t very good. It wasn't very well writen either. The book is about a jewish boy named Mark who is going to have his Bar Mitzvah. He plays baseball for his temple league and he is on the B'nai B'riths, but they call their team the B'nai Bagels. His mother was the manager of the team, and his brother was the coach. Mark's best friend named Hersch had moved away before the book started. He really only moved far enough away to have to go to a different regular school, but was still on Mark's baseball team, and went to his hebrew school. There were a couple good parts, but nothing was more than a little interesting. Most of the book was boring and just his average life."
2,Great machine for the price!,"I just received my 50-850 today, assembled it in about a hour.I found it to be heavy duty, well for the price it is, I had previously installed my metal duct work and ready to go; this dust collector sucks very well, now I can work in a clean inviroment. I have earnestly searched for the best price to quality ratio and found this one to be a winner , I would have given it a 5 star but I only have had it for one day!"
2,Dialogues with God,Mrs. Roberts has authored several books and I have read them all. Their content comes from a lady with a very deep and personal relationship with God. Her words are very inspiring and leads to a closer walk with the Lord. They are of much help when seeking guidance as we walk daily seeking a new and fresher walk with the Lord. I would give each of them a five star rating.I have spoken personally with Mrs. Roberts and she is a very gracious lady.Margaret C. Duran/Author of Life In Satan's Grip and others.
2,Rock Solid Gameplay,"Links 2004 is a fairly decent golf game. You get to choose and design your player and then start off on a career. The controls are fairly easy and there's really no learning curve to this game. One you pass a few tests, new courses and tournaments open up. The one thing I didn't like were the announcers in this game. Their commentary is so choppy it gets annoying, fast.Despite the game's uneven presentation, Links 2004 is still a good choice. The game is not much different from Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004, but it's generally not as polished or feature-rich."
1,sophomoric or soporific? both!,"The deluge of both five- and one-star reviews precludes any sober assessment of this novel.Kudos to the author for his moxie and his admission of sabotaging the amazon reviews. Unlike many commentators, I have read the book. I discovered a flimsy structure, cringingly-poor dialogue, and an adolescent-level understanding of intertext, its importance, its subtlety. As it was a first novel, he will no doubt seek to improve (though not for pedantic boors like myself)"
2,Now I know!,"How did weight lifters gain muscle before the time of magazine super-workouts and supplements? This book answers that question. I never thought the key to gaining mass could be so simple and straight-forward. Not only did I learn great techniques and how to develop my own workout, I was also fueled by a ton of motivational content. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's serious about gaining mass without all the hype and expense of mags and supplements!"
2,A cut above the rest,"The Gingher G-4 4-Inch Classic Embroidery Scissors is so sharp, I cut myself just opening its presentation tin. Enough said."
1,Red Hat Linux is an absolute ZERO!! Read info,"I tried to like it. I really did, but a person does need a degree in computer science to install any new programs. The mp3 player is disabled, no video player, and incompatibility with most online programs out there. I don't like windows but I absolutely HATE Linux Redhat 9.0. I wanted to burn a CD of my work before I switched back to Windows, but even the damn CD burning program would'nt burn the CD. All it said was no data even though I moved the data I wanted to be burn't in the appropriate box.My father would say something is PISS POOR when it was the absolute lowest quality possible. Linux Redhat is truly a piss poor product. I threw out the CDs and now I am going back to Window Millenium because at least that works and I can actually get other programs to work with it.Piss Poor garbage! Buy Windows!!!!"
1,Misleading Title,"Much of what we dislike about about standard high school history classes is found here. I kept hoping for explanations of the decline, only to be buried by more names, dates and medieval middle eastern minutae."
1,Not Free SF Reader,"This odd series I didn't find too interesting. Maybe I would if I was an invading alien sex therapist. This is almost a horror story, with how creepy it is in parts. Condescending aliens treating people at times how people treat animals, which perhaps it part of the point?"
2,Another great album. Production lacks though.,"The songs on this album are very good and are intresting and engaging. Yet for some reason I can't completely get into it. The production (the first time the band produced an album themselves) is lacking. The production takes away from the songs and the album as a whole. Fugazi (both on record and live) have an amazing guitar sound and a thick, intricate, tight rhythm section. But here the guitars sound very weak and the drums and bass sound a little artificial. This type of extremly sterile production suits songs like ""Long Division"" which is softer but take away from songs ""Reclamation"" and ""Nice New Outfit"" which have a more live feel to them. The songs on this album are very good but because of the production I can't give it a 5."
1,Don't waste your time,"A pathetic ripoff of V. Sure, it's sci-fi, but it's horribly unrealistic, ie, the sheer stupidity of the characters which makes you wonder how they managed to survive in the first place. Then there's the corny dialog. The Spielberg connection should have been my first clue that this was going to blow chunks. Shame on me."
2,A fine pick for any lending library,"John Lescroart's THE MERCY RULE receives a fine performance by David Colacci, whose decades of audio recording experience lend a seasoned tone to this story of a former bartender and reluctant defense attorney who faces a challenging case that threatens his family life. A fine pick for any lending library."
2,"For Anyone Who gets ""Blue"" in the Dark Days of Winter","The Winter Blues is an excellent guide for anyone who is affected by the darker days of Winter...it is very encouraging for anyone w/this often misunderstood malady & those who care for someone, who suffers through it. It is great to read that it can so simply be improved or reversed & that their quality of life can be restored so easily."
2,Great,"My daughter loved seeing this in the theater, and was so happy to have the complete set now! Great series"
1,The Cat Who Earned Two Stars,"The Cat Who Went Bananas, by Lilian Jackson Braun, is a rather slight novel that sadly seems to have been written for the sole purpose of producing a book, rather than telling a story. The paperthin plot does not inpsire much interest. I had a difficult time determining what the book was about and whether or not there was any mystery involved. I remembered somebody mentioning a person had died, and then there was a missing book, but I could not for the life of me remember why. This was my fourth book in the series, after starting with the first three. I think I had better continue with the series in order as the quality comparison between the first three and this one decreased drastically.Two stars."
1,NEED TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE BATTERIES,"Because the recorder cannot be turned on and off, the batteries are constrantly being drained. In other words, even if you do not use the recorder for a couple of weeks, you may find that you not longer have charged batteries, and therefore have to continually replace, reprogram, etc."
1,terrible,"this movie was terrible....I went into the theater skepical because I heard that the screenwriters were untested...well, this disastorpiece is what you get as a result. The movie did so poorly that it bankrupted Square Pictures.The dialouge was filled with one liners, wasted several talented actors like Donald Sutherland. The drama seemed artificial, and the story was just bad. What I did like about this movie is that it showed that adult-oriented computer animated productions are possible instead of the childrens movies by Pixar (Monsters Inc....which was actually FAR BETTER than this)This movie is just bad....avoid it...I want to see them make a movie out of Final Fantasy 6, which was the best of the series in my opinion"
1,the puzzler,"I loved Sit & Solve Cryptograms, but I was very disappointed with S&SC#2. The authors were more interested in finding quotes that didn't contain words like ""the"" than they were in finding interesting and meaningful quotes. Most were just a bunch of jibberish. Also, the font used is very small and close together, making it very difficult to read what you've solved."
2,The Inside Track,"Just Ballin' is a good read which really gives you the inside track of an NBA Franchise owned by a billion dollar corporation. You also see how professional teams are effected internally by things such as bad attitudes, personal beliefs, or lack of commitment to the team. This book tells you in-depth about the 1999 New York Knicks and how the entire mess was somehow able to come together for an unforgettable playoff run. A good read for any basketball fan and a must read for Knicks fans."
1,too narrow for high arches,"This is a nice, pretty and comfortable-looking sandal, but this shoe fits too tightly on slightly high arched feet such as mine. I can almost always wear a medium in any shoe, but not in this case... and since I can't wear it in my normal size, I can't recommend it."
2,Insider's view,"This book gives us an inside look at the life of Solomon Wickey. It fills in a lot of the blanks as to how he became an herbalist, and why and how he works. I was surprised by how much tragedy he has experienced. I had heard about the lawsuit, but reading about it was enlightening, to say the least. I'm impressed he went back to practicing afterwards.If you like this book, I recommendHe's Not Autistic But...: How We Pulled Our Son From the Mouth of the Abyss. While the title may not sound related, the author describes the healing art of releasing that Solomon uses, and gives more detail and explanation on the codes and how to use them."
1,Buyer Beware..,Sound quality was horrible.. We bought this due to Plantronics product reputation.. What a disappointment.. We read a few others reviews that stated the same thing yet took a chance.. Sometimes you just got to trust others opinions..
1,Squeak squeak,"I have always worn florsheim shoes. Last year I bought 3 different pair. I am only writing on these because they are the loudest. I am so embarrassed to wear them. Sore feet and squeaking has always been the norm the first couple of weeks, then like magic they would become the perfect fit. Now people hear me coming from so far away. I have soaked them in liquid oil and finally went to saddle soap. Stretching only made this pair worse. My other pairs, courtland and lexington also too loud to wear to work. Disposable..."
2,Horatio Alger meets 'Star Wars' in this humorous scifi novel,"Simply put, this book is a hoot! The author has hit on a potent combination of wry humor and science fiction in a mode slightly reminiscent of the 'Mars Attacks!' movie - but with a bit more substance. The protagonist is an unlikely Americanized Bengali tycoon, who must deal with the aliens in a manner he is most familiar with--the world of Big Business. Highly recommended."
2,deluxe wonder wheeler,This cart is perfect for the beach. It holds a lot of junk and is easy to maneuver.
2,Good...,I just bought this item two days and boy it is worth my money! It doesn't playback on my discman but it said that constantly that it's not going to work with all cd audio players. It almost blew my ears when I played the DVD side for the disc. I am always interested in acquiring new music. I visited the website and it gave no specific lists of CD & DVD players that would work with the CD audio side. I think that I will wait to buy another DualDisc until they give a list of players that can read the DualDisc CD side.
1,"Jean Donaldson & Ian Dunbar - ""Fighting Dominance in a Dog Whispering World""","I was very disappointed with the entire disc one of this product; the Jean Donaldson part is something one could glean from a chapter of a book on the science & mythology of dominance theories. Her oration skills are not as professional as one would expect from a so-called-expert, as well.On the other hand, Dr. Ian Dunbar (as always), is stupendous!!! So only disc two makes the product worth keeping in ones collection. Disc 2 has a total running time of: 1 hour & 47 minutes. He is a brilliant, humorous speaker with very note-worthy examples.=^..^=gayhl"
2,Fantastic mouse!,"Optical is the only way to go. Gone are the days of cleaning the ball and the rollers. This mouse works on any surface and is actually more precise that the old ball style mouse. The mouse wheel for scrolling is really handy also. Some games even use the wheel for weapons selection, etc. I prefer this version over the more expensive offering from Microsoft because there are too many buttons on the other one. They get in the way."
1,Not for people with conservative values,"I borrowed this book on my Kindle and returned it after just a few chapters. I've read many thousands of pages from books about food and cooking, but this was the first time I ever encountered a sex scene in such a book. I thought I could overlook discussions about illegal drug use and some harsh language, but it was just too much for me.I read a short description of the book before I borrowed it, but it wasn't at all what I expected. I guess I should have read the reviews before attempting to read it. I guess this guy is someone on TV, so people who have seen him may know what to expect, but I'm TV-less and was completely broadsided."
1,A Disappointment,"This might have been a pretty good article, but there is just not enough interesting material for a book on the subject. Most of these guys were working class amateurs who made a couple of records. I have listened to a number of compilations that include many of the people that the author mentions. Believe me, there are no lost ""masters"" among them. The author cannot even really define ""rockabilly"" in any coherent fashion, and many of his judgments appear quite arbitrary. A short-lived, transitional phenomenon. Not worth the price unless you are a fanatic fan of the music."
1,almost killed my cat,"Be careful to NEVER leave this toy out, or if the feather part breaks off (which it easily will) DO NOT leave it lying around. My cat ended up eating the hard red plastic tip that holds together the feathers. After vomiting 6x, he had to have surgery to remove it. Seriously a shame because my cats love playing with it."
1,Buyer Beware,"I was very disappointed with these cd's. They said they were the original recording. They are absolutely NOT the originals. You could tell they were the artists performing the songs, but NOT the originals songs you are familiar with."
1,might as well use a purse!,"Boy, you read these reviews and most of you guys sound like you outta wear dresses. I'll take my 10 year old 21 Oz. Dalluge against any of you guys and well race for pinks, 20 8d galvs in a plywood break - 6"" O.C.; or first one through a box of 16d's. That is if your poor elbows can handle it and you are not too fatigued to make it up to the roof. Seriously, any hammerhand knows that good corrugation (""milling"")and balance is the key to efficient nail driving. Any hammer knowadays flattens out in a matter of days, even if you only pound nails. Of course I favor legislation that would make it a crime to use a hammer on a catspaw,other metal tools, on concrete, or on any other surface not made of wood or nails. Drop my skilsaw, cut my cord, but abuse my baby Dalluge and you got trouble. Unfortunately, they don't make em like they use to."
1,Bad Choice,"I ordered these because they claimed to be for ""heavy wetters"" hoping to put one in with our already sturdy inserts. They don't work well at all. I would never recommend them to anyone."
1,Project 8 should be more like Project Beta,"Beware, this game should not have been released to the public so soon. I have played the game three times and it has frozen each time. I have unlocked 6 areas and each time I attempt a new goal it freezes up. The new trick mode is great, but many aspects of the game are unpolished, including the graphics; buildings don't connect evenly with the ground. Do yourself a favor and save your money, there are plenty of ""Out Of Bounds"" areas in Wasteland."
1,FIlter,There was no difference in how the moon looked when we used this product versus not using it. I feel it was a waste of money.
1,Don't even bother,I did not like this product at all. It was my first cooling pad and was the worst. I believe it lasted 3 months before it broke. The problem is that it's made too cheaply. The plug to connect it to your computer's USB port became loose without hardly ever being moved. I'm usually in the same spot with my laptop and this thing still broke. I wouldn't recommend it.Good Luck!
1,"I'm late, I'm late for a very important date","This is my first Timex watch that does not keep accurate time. It runs 5 to 7 minutes late every day. I do not recommend this watch. Even for the low price, give today's technology, and the Timex reputation, a Timex watch should keep accurate time. Oops! gota go. I'm late!"
1,alex j,"i received the batterys today but i was under the impression that they came with a charger. that is why i choose these.I could have gotten the same from Wal-mart,not happy with this deal"
2,enjoyable,"The movie was a little slow paced, but once the story line built my intrest was kept. The acting was very good, except the acting is a constant reminder of twlight. over all I would recommend this moive to people who enjoy theatrical era time lines."
1,Should have heeded reviews...,"After carefully reading all the reviews, we decided to go ahead and order this frig using the 1-day shipping option. We thought that certainly Amazon had fixed the problem. The frig arrived today with a bad dent in the door so we're sending it back. I guess the guy who recommended buying this product in the store was right."
1,Absolutely disgusting,"I realize this book was supposed to be a satire of our culture in the 80's. It could've been done without the horrific and disgusting descriptions of the murders the protagonist conducted. I am not kidding when I say I was absolutely revolted. A good writer should be able to get his point across without excess, and this was excessive violence beyond the pale."
1,Falling in Love,This movie is about nothing but adultery. Fall in love before you get married. I like a movie that lifts my spirit not show how selfish people can be.
1,Too negative for my taste,"Although her tremendous talent shines through these early movies, I found the subject matter pretty depressing."
2,Rising SON,This movie is awesome to see what happens to ICONs in the skate world. Brings back memories if you have ever skated before than you know this guy is trust me a nice purchase.
2,Caring about children and giving hope through divorce,"This book does not make it seem like the hurt of divorce is no big deal,but it gives hope that life will eventually get better. You can see the emotions through the faces of the people in the drawings. Anybody can be helped if they read this book."
1,HOW TO REVIEW SOMETHING THAT NEVER ARRIVED????,"I would love more than anything to review this movie. However, I have not yet received it -- and my inquiries to the seller have all gone unanswered. I ordered it on December 5...it is now January 7...and still no movie!This has taught me a great lesson -- DO NOT EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM AN AMAZON SELLER!!!! IT IS NOT WORTH THE HASSLE! They have my money now...no wonder they don't bother to answer any inquiries about where my product is!!"
2,Classic Journey!,"This is the recording that really started to define Journey's 80s sound. A fine mix of melody, blues and straight forward rock'n'roll. A must for any Journey fan."
2,Happy,Very pleased. I have used maca before and I like it in my smoothies for energy. I should get a lot of smoothies from this 2.2lb bag. Looking forward to placing more orders in the future.Mk
1,A few minutes of horror,"There's about 15 minutes of horror film. But the rest of the 2 hours is made up of 2 confused people trying to come to terms with their histories which are related to the horror story portion by analogy (and the man's brief contact with the dead children). There was supposed to be a psychological reason behind the horror -- but it didn't strike me as particularly insightful. Instead it was dreary. The acting, even by Jun Ji Hyun, was dreary. The actions by the characters were dreary. The only sign of life comes from the fiancée -- a strong, dynamic performance by attractive Yu Seon.TO see Jun Ji Hyun at her best, I recommendMY SASSY GIRL,DAISY, orIL MARE."
1,Tasco Essentials 10-30X50 Binoculars,"This is a cheap product, so not much can be expected. Optics are poor, and even in tropical sunlight (I am using them in Cartagena, Colombia) images are dull with little resolution.The zoom function does not permit a smooth transition when it is being adjusted.My recommendation to prospective buyers is to spend more for better quality zoom binoculars, or to stick with fixed 7 X 50 or 10 X 50 models and invest in better optics.More care needs to be taken with the packing - my binoculars arrived with one of the object lens tubes bent out of its mounting on the prism case. Fortunately the threads were only slightly deformed and I was able to re-assemble the binicoulars satisfactorily."
1,Perverted band that doesn't deserve your money or attention,"I would give this 'zero' stars, but that option is not available. I'm sure that finger nails running down a chalk board would sound better than anything by this ""band.""The lead singer has sodomized a skinned calf on stage and has placed rats in a blender and had the audience drink it. He has photos of this at his website. This is beyond demented and sick; it is certainly not ""art.""Hopefully the humane society will get involved to stop the animal abuse which is carried on by the band members.Unforunately we are now living in a society where morality is decaying and where doing perverted things on stage covers for lack of talent. Don't give these untalented, disgusting perverts your money and don't see them perform live. Gets a grade of F"
1,Very Poor Design and Not Kid Friendly,"Now, I would be the first to write a letter on how wonderful a toy is made but this toy... this toy is the worst I've ever encountered. Cheaply made, not functional, doesn't stay together, pieces won't stay on, I could go on and on. After I write this I intend to write to the makers of this toy as well. They should be ashamed of this product. When you want to pack ""Mack"" up, you have to remove the launcher and my wife even had a hard time removing it. You feel like your about to break it. They could have done something so much better than this for the money. Simply put, you will do better to stay away from this one all together. What a disapointment...."
1,Did not Grow Well,"Despite following all instructions, I got barely 3 or 4 seedlings from the whole kit. It was quite a disappointment. I planted tomato seeds at the same time and every single one grew!"
2,great zombie movie,this movie will be right up there with George Romero zombie movies very well done if you don't have this movie go out and buy it
2,AWESOMENESSESSSESS,"what can i sayits a 25FT headphone Extender , its AWESOMEbetter review SOON on youtube ( Audiogod9000 )"
2,I Loved it...,"As someone who never took the time or effort before to make salad dressing, this device makes it a breeze. And the dressing is so good. The ingredients and measurements are printed on the side, and there are several great recipes to choose from. I was glad I tracked the product down online because I've been unable to find it in stores. It's a great hostess gift."
1,Pseudo Psychology,I bought this book with high hopes based on the reviews at Amazon but I reckon they must have been written by the author - 'cos the book is rubbish.
2,"Once again ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jimmy Buffett..","Thank you Jim. Oysters and Pearls will become the ""new"" Buffett classic. A maturing transition, with the perpetual spice he brings us, on occasion! My children love your tunes now, as much as I loved them 20 years ago. Thanks again."
1,"They are shipping it by the each, with NO BRACKET, and NO BULB!","Amazon is shipping it by the each, with NO BRACKET, and NO BULB! No wiring either! What a rip off! Totally different than pictured."
1,"Totally, utterly pointless.","If you've seen the first one, you will be severely disappointed. Vince Vaughn's acting is so forced and subconscious I wonder how he even got the part. I would remark on Ann Heche's performance but it was so unforgettable I can't."
2,One of the best albums of the year,"To all those people giving this album 1 star because it's too ""soft"", OPEN YOUR EARS. David Draiman may have toned down his lyrics, but the guitar riffs and music are still as heavy as ever. Disturbed has not gone soft by any means, they have just showed the maturity and guts to improve their great style to near perfect. For all you who really like the harder Disturbed songs like ""The Game"" and ""Stupify"" from The Sickness, will love ""Intoxication"" and ""Rise."" And, for all those who can really appreciate a great singing voice will really like ""Breathe"" and ""Darkness."" ""Darkness,"" by the way, is one of those ballads that all metal bands write, but few do well. Disturbed does it right (as do Metallica, Pantera, and Sevendust). As for my favorite song, it has got to be ""Prayer."" It is the first single and sold me on the CD before I heard any other song. In conclusion, BUY THIS CD, YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED."
1,Even my husband thinks this book is stupid,"The basic premise of this book is that women are manipulative creatures who should only be interested in cooking, sex for their husbands, taking care of children, and keeping all negative thoughts to themselves. I thought that I was missing something from this book, so I gave it to my husband to read. He was actually insulted that Dr. Laura called him ""simple,"" and thought that the book was way off the mark. Only buy this book if you are also willing to get a lobotomy so that you can become a Stepford Wife, too."
1,there is one good reason to see this movie,"Namely, if you want to see what Miami Beach & South Beach looked like before the revitalization of the late 1980's. Can't think of any other purpose though (unless you, like me, remember it as a guilty pleasure from HBO in the early 80's, back when we didn't have clickers and changed cable channels using a foot long box with about 15 buttons & a dial)"
2,TOMTOM0NE LEATHER CARRYCASE,PROVIDES EXCELLENT PROTECTION FOR THE TOMTOM UNIT. FITS VERY WELL AND IS EASY TO TRANSPORT
1,"Same story, different town","I first read the Yellow Rose Trilogy which I loved!!! That is why I bought the California series. I am giving this 2 stars not because it isn't a good book. It would have been a good book if I hadn't read the Yellow Rose Trilogy first. This is more of the same. Boy meets girl. Won't admit their love. Share a common faith. Finally admit they love each other. The only thing different is the names and the town!! Lori Wick is an excellent author and I share her faith in Christ. I just feel this is ""more of the same""."
2,helpful book,"This book has great pictures. It is not as comprehensive as I would have liked, but is still a very helpful guide to 60's fashion."
2,"A modern day ""everyman's"" guide to enlightenment","This slim volume offers a modern approach to ancient wisdom. It's simplicity is refreshing; it's message profound. In an entertaining, narrative story form this writer makes the deepest Truths accessable and memorable. It's the kind of book that after you read it, you'll want to buy it for all your loved ones.Row, Row, Row is not your average self-help book. It's a real life changer."
1,Does anyone LIVE like this?,"Seriously, the book is beautifully photographed and the rooms are very well designed if you like rooms where no one actually has to LIVE...I think from an purists' point of view, this is a great study of design but if you are looking for a book to give you actual, usable ideas for re-designing your condo space - get a different book. I regret buying it as I was looking for more than a visually stunning coffee table book (which it definitely qualifies as). I was looking for realistic design ideas.Each of the spaces looks like no one has or ever COULD live in them.But, if you have tons of money and no personal possessions, this might give you some useable ideas."
1,Just read Bill James himself...,"This book could have been titled ""The Best of Bill James"" instead of ""The Mind of Bill James."" About 70% of the book is just excerpts from old publications of James', often inserted without any real context or additional insight. Gray, when he appears, is a decent writer but not a great one, and I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that his writing style often seems derivative of James himself.Fun in parts, but poorly edited, disorganized, and ultimately a very sparse book."
2,For the insight you wish you already had and to reaffirm truths you do,"Great as a reference or to pick up for a needed light hearted moment; life can be so brutal it's good to review the tools of civility to keep your composure (dignity). For example, "" the handkerchief... every civilized person is supposed to carry one.."" (cracks me up) plus a lot of serious issues, great reading."
2,Garfield,"My grandson loved the movie and begged me to buy him the DVD for his Birthday, I have to say even the adults in the family loved it."
2,A Paradise of Reading...,"I loved it. The very first Tami Hoag book I ever read and I damn loved it. She has a way of trapping people's attention with her words, her breathtaking descritptions and incredible characters. I couldn't stop reading it!"
1,shallow book with no redeeming social value,This book teaches little girls that looking good in your pink tutu is the most important part of ballet and life.
2,Good version,"This movie is good, I am a Jessica Beil fan and she is the main reason I hunted this one down to buy. Jessica does great in it as well as her boyfriend. He is a great actor.Would defiently buy again.Great addtion to my collection!"
2,One of the Best Zappa Albums,"I AM HUGE ZAPPA NUT, AND THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES. THE FIRST DISC HAS ALMOST EVERY TRACK FROM ROXY AND ELSEWHERE, WHICH I LOVE. IT ALSO HAVE THE AMAZING ""INCA ROADS"" WITH BEAUTIFUL SINGER GEORGE DUKE ON VOCALS AND KEYBOARDS. I ESPECIALLY LOVE HOW THEY OPEN WITH ""TUSH TUSH TUSH"". THIS IS DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE FOR ANY ZAPPA FAN. EVEN IF YOU DON'T OWN ANY OTHER ZAPPA ALBUMS, AND YOU WANT TO START GETTING INTO HIM, THIS WOULD BE 1 OF AROUND 5 OR 6 ALBUMS THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND. DEFINITELY BUY THIS ALBUM, I LISTEN TO IT LITERALLY ALMOST EVERYDAY I LOVE IT SO MUCH. LONG LIVE FZ!"
2,this is an awesome gift for beginners,"if uve got a friend or a child , sibling, or if ud just like to get into this card game, i highly suggest this starter deck"
1,Not good,I didn't like this movie at all. If you are not watching this movie closely you can get confused on what the plot is about. it could have been produced better.
2,Get Yourself a Cup of Java and Enjoy,"I was alerted to this book by way of a write up in a popular woman's magazine. It's fun and very VERY funny. It's not a hard read, by any means...but, very fun. It's something sweet and nice for those bus,cab,subway trips or hanging out in a coffeehouse."
1,Not my kind of game,"This isn't necessarily a bad game, but I found the difficult controls and awkward fighting to be annoying. Fans of Max Payne, Halo, and other games of that ilk should consider renting this game before buying it."
1,Kimble J review: David Frizzell Best of The Best,"Anything by David Frizzell is impossible to get here in Australia. Nobody seems to even list him. There was only one song I was interested in and that was ""You're the Reason God Made Oklahoma"". I was a little disappointed that this version did not feature his sister in law, Dotty West, as his singing partner. Also this version seems to be a little more rock and roll but the melody is the same. Given the difficulty in getting anything by David in the past, I guess I have to accept that beggars can't be choosers and cop it sweet. The rest of the album did not appeal to me at all. The songs sounded tired and the music seemed weak and non committal. Maybe one day I will see a copy with Dotty West and I can purchase it."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE - Don't Buy It,"I ordered this as an alternative to buying an ipod. Not only is it slow when trying to flip through the song library, but it also feels cheap and fragile. Now comes the biggest part - after a *week* of using it I tried to turn it on. The screen lit up and showed the ""sandisk"" logo and then slowly faded to black and froze there! After this the player wouldn't even turn off or do anything at all! Customer service DIDNT HELP at all and this product is just a waste of time and money!! DONT BUY IT!!! I've also had a couple of friends who have had the same experience as me (I found this out after I had purchased it)."
2,Perfect image quality,"This is a perfect camara with perfect image quality and rockbottom price around three hundred dollars with deals. How ever the batteries that came with the camara drained off in 2 min. Also, I dont like the sound it makes while the camara zooms in and out, sounds as if the motor inside is grinding some thing. I would also have liked a webcam functionality, which it lacks. Also, the digital zoom is pathetic, don't expect to use it. The screen goes blank for a second and the zoomed picture comes up. Continuous digital zoom whould have been nice.Now that functionality that I like, microphone with movie capture, connect to tv and play pics and movies, picture quality which is the most important thing, easy interface and manual settings for picture capture."
2,Missed it!,"Man this brings back memories, glad it's here. I'm not an audio perfectionist by any means but to me it sounds great and reminds me of the times when I owned the vinyl. I forgot just how good it was!"
2,Pony Wise,"I think Anna is a really smart girl. She knows that ponies can't be allowed to do just what they want to do, the rider is in charge! That way the pony (or horse) and rider will get along. My cousin and I live on farms with ponies (and horses...there is a difference!) and, just like Anna, we know that the pony must be kept under control. Otherwise it's no fun! I just want to ask something. My cousin has two Shetland ponies who are really small-and full grown! We're both nine years old and I'm starting to out-grow Mona, my welsh pony. So how can the Pony Pals still be perfect for their ponies? Especially Anna? All in all, a great book!"
2,The system does work very well,"This book was recommended to me by several highly successful people in the business world. These people emphasized that this book was the reason why they were so successful. It was with that in mind that I purchased this book.There is no spin in spin selling. The title may imply some sort of deception, but that's very far from the truth. Spin is an acronym for the technique this book is teaching. I'm saying this because I've encountered a number of people who decided to judge this book on its title rather than giving it a fair reading.Spin selling puts the reader in a position to understand what the customer is looking for and will be able to make recommendations in order to help them. The technique here is all about the customer rather than ripping the customer off. Spin selling, in that way, is about developing a relationship with the customer in order to guarantee more business with them in the future.Give it a look and see for yourself."
1,CAn't hardly recognize Gillan here...,"I couldn't hardly recognize Gillan here. The album is weak, poppish, something really weird."
1,did not like,"Did not like this crock pot. It is way to heavy and has too many ""don't do"" things such as no metal utensils."
1,Where is Sinatra?,"Why use Frank Sinatra's ""I Thought About You"" in the movie and then not release it on the soundtrack??"
1,NOT a SLOW cooker.,"Even on the lowest setting it boiled, it cooks at way too high a temperature. Food was overcooked, it is a waste of money. I'll stick with my old one. You would think appliances could be IMPROVED upon over time. It looks good, but doesn't do the job for which it is intended."
2,THIS IS THEIR BEST!,"I saw this band in 1976. In the 70's you never knew what a band was going to throw out there for the fan. What a fantastic concert! Nothing surprises me anymore, but The Tubes did and those who have never seen them are missing a treat. This cd is their best without question. Mondo Bondage and White Punks On Dope are my favorites. If you don't have this cd, it's a must for The Tubes fan."
1,"Santana , the band and Man, too talented for Shaman","The Shaman must understand the oneness of the mundane and spiritual. Santana has understood and passed this understanding to us with partners such as John Mclaughlin and Alice Coltrane and maintained the integrity of his art. His more popular music efforts have still shown this understanding, just check out his first three albums and many others.Santana, both the band and the Man are just too great musicians to give us this watered down pop. There are thousands of musicians who can do this pop, but only one Santana. It is time Santana listens to his art and not the music business.Viva Santana!"
2,Timeless Resource,"David Ogilvy is one of the titans of advertising, and this book provides timeless insights into the business and psychology of the advertising business. Covering print, TV, radio and direct marketing - as well as career advice for the aspiring advertising professional, the book - though now 30 years old, still resonates. The element emphasized by Ogilvy that allows it to maintain his relevance was a quote he took from Bill Bernbach - human nature hasn't changed over the years, and won't. Advertising appeals to our fundamental nature, and Ogilvy captures it in a way that is both informative and entertaining. Full of color and black & white ads and examples, the book also gives the 21st century reader a nostalgic look at 20th century advertising. Interesting and worth reading."
2,Professional package at Prosumer price,"I am a professional and we've used these now for about 5 years (maybe more) -- it is an incredible value for the money. I've put these up against Wireless systems that cost +/- 4000 USD and the Sennheiser knocks the windsocks off the ""professional"" brands as far as I'm concerned. We have (more than once) concealed one of these on a race car driver, under his racesuit and picked up perfect audio as long as he was in range ... which I think is better than some of the competitors as well!"
2,Great value! Actually works!,"I was excited after I received my shipment and hurried up to set it up in just minutes! As a freelance photographer, I get many requests for still life photography, but sometimes I run into problems like bad lighting, background, etc. This little studio solved my problem! The only draw back: the lights heat up REALLY fast! You have to shut them down every 10 minutes or so, or you will start smelling things!"
1,Miguel Ruiz is a sociopath,"This book is a poorly written, self aggrandizing impiety.There's a reason why cultures die. Because they no longer serve the current belief system of the advancing culture. However, since this whole ""ancient belief system"" was enshrouded in mystery, one can't question if Miguel's ridiculous tautology is fiction or fact. Which I'd imagine that he understood (that's why it's a secret) and is crucial to his marketing campaign--granting exemption to personal accountability and empathy.Usually when cultures live in secret it's because their beliefs are too abhorrent (think KKK) for the current societal values. We've been advanced for a while now, I'm guessing that the one thing that the ancient human sacrificing aztecs and our current society have in common is that we are all allergic to sociopaths.The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom, A Toltec Wisdom Book"
1,Not for glass top ranges,I bought this expecting a high quality product but the bottom is not flat and it does not work well on my glass top range. I would not buy this again. Only way I can use it is to go outside and cook on my gas grill's side burner. Bummer.
2,A note for you........,"Lynn Leistinger (Clifton Park, NY) :You can get Kill City on www.musicstack.com the original bomp green one.I had to post this here, so you'd get it. Couldn't find an e-mail address for you. I tried.Lol.You have great taste in music.Diane. :)))"
2,syd as it should be...,"With some doubts as to the overall song-writing quality i was a bit apprehensive before listening to Syd's solo non-floyd debut, but more to my surprise it turned out to be quite the album more on a mellow scale...while not as acomplished as Waters and Gilmours solo albums, Barrett shows what the aforementioned dont always achieve - genuine and unbrideled emotion coupled with sheer honesty. In some tracks Barrett sounds as if he had never sung a note before in his life i.e. ""If its in you"" and on others such as ""Octopus"" he has never sounded better. The inconsistent attributes of this album do not take away as one might derive but add to the uniqueness of this album making it oneof those albums that grow after repeated listening's. Overall quite good giving his earlier such albums as ""piper"" a run for its money."
1,Manage Your Expecations!,"I spent alot of time checking out the reviews of competitive products. Many reviews warned of the static-y connections inherent in these products (...likely due to the power output limits placed on the devices by the FCC). I was hoping this would be different but bottom line - - it delivers pretty disappointing sound. Lots of occasional static, hissing, and the dynamic range always sounds noticeably compressed/muffled. Since this is my second FM transmitter with the same limitation, I now believe it's a problem inherent with the technology. It's particularly noticeable since for the past 10-20 years, I think we've grown accustomed to the crystal-clear sound of CDs.My advice: Get a ""hard wire"" direct factory connection kit (expensive) or bring your car to some independent car stereo shop and have them run a direct connection cable out from the back of your radio in through the dashboard ($100-$150), and then connect your ipod through that."
1,It's ok,"I think the music is ok. I would not call Joe Jackson a genuis. Sounds like a musical and he just put it together in his own way. The best and my personal favorite is SLOTH with guest singer Brad Robert from the Crash Test Dummies. Awsome song. But Joe Jackson ruins it by singing in it. He is winey and irratating. But for $1.50 I got it for, is worth the buy for one song."
1,Weather Report-the easy listening version,"I was initially excited when I first saw this CD, then disappointed after hearing it. With exception of Scofield, the Brecker Brothers, and Sanborn the whole thing lacks energy. It seems that the music was ""smoothed"" out for easy listening, lite jazz radio play. I suppose if it gets people to go back and listen to the original recordings its done it's job, but I expected better."
2,I've fallen in love!!!,"I've had my Kindle for a day and I already love it. The e-ink display is literally just like paper and very easy on the eyes. I've heard people complain about how easy it is to flip pages accidently, but it only took me about 30 seconds to figure out a good place to put my thumb and find a comfortable way to hold it. I suspect it will be different for everyone. It seems easier to hold it outside of it's cover, but I like the protection that the cover offers.I do have a suggestion for a future version. Specifically for people with learning disabilities - it would be nice to be able to highlight the line of text that you are reading. I know some people who use an index card for books and could easily use that with the Kindle as well, but it would be a nice feature to add."
1,Arrived broken,"I ordered this as a gift for my nephew, and the iron shavings were leaking out of it before he even opened it. We can't say how fun or educational it is since he never got to play with it."
2,Great portable nailer,Honestly a great finish nailer to use. It has lots of power and is really easy to handle with no air hose and compressor. If anyone is interested in this finish nailer I would highly recommened it. I have both the bostitch and a dewalt finish nailers and they don't compare to this 18 volt dewalt model. One down side of the nailer can be the weight which is a little over eight pounds but you seem to get use to it. I got mine brand new at Lowes for $339 and it came in a pack with the 18 volt dewalt circular saw.
2,Great!,"I like em a lot, wife thinks they're the best cereal she's ever had, teen daughter thinks they taste just a bit better than hamster food, the others here like them enough. Bags are pretty small but still a good enough deal that I'll buy again, just too good (and a unique flavor...really like the pumpkin seeds in them) not to."
1,very disappointed,"The crockpot arrived very dented and cheaply made. NOt at all happy with its appearance. The functionality is fine, however will not buy this brand again."
1,Major Disappointment,"I bought this movie based on the reviews here, watched it then I threw it in the trash. Major Disappointment - don't waste your money."
2,From start to finish nothing but pure viking pride,I am one of the most commited vikings fans and well Mr. Klobuchar you did it. You have enclosed all of our purple and gold ambition. This book is for any one who has given up a Monday night to watch their team play.
1,Lemon deluxe,"My Dewalt DW788 arrived from Amazon, and would not work whatsoever. Advise steering clear of this brand, and buy locallywhere customer relations are more important."
2,"''ALWAYS BUSINESS, NEVER PERSONAL''","ICE-T LAUNCHED HIS FILM CAREER WITH THIS MEMORABLE 1991 CULT CLASSIC. THIS MOVIE FOLLOWS THE LIFE AND TIMES OF A DRUG KINGPIN NAMED NINO BROWN [WESLEY SNIPES. NINO THINKS HE'S UNTOUCHABLE BUT THREE STREET-SMART COPS ARE WORKING ON A BIG PLAN TO BRING NINO TO JUSTICE. THIS MOVIE IS SOMETIMES ACCUSED OF GLORIFYING DRUG DEALERS, BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN THE CASE. THIS MOVIE WAS MADE TO SHOW THE DANGERS OF BEING A DRUG DEALER AND IT SHOWS WHY DRUGS ARE ILLEGAL. THERE'S GREAT PERFORMANCES FROM EVERYBODY IN THE CAST. PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THIS FILM'S POWERFUL ANTI-MESSAGE. THIS MOVIE INSPIRED MANY IMITATIONS AND CLONES."
2,DataShark 70003 Universal Cable Stripper/Cutter,Works just fine for cutting/stripping ethernet. Only go around once.
2,It Is the Dream Come Alive!,Once you realize they've attended film school and overlook some initial pretentions I believe you'll simply tumble into the dream with awe and delight. Extraordinary. Few film makers could realize this mood and enchantment. Plus... alittle scary!
2,Guitar Rock,"Compared to other 80's bands, Ratt showed more musicianship than most. This one ranks as one of their best."
2,Every leader and anyone being led should read this!,Best book I've read in a while. Brings scripture to life in an engaging way. Buy it now and resolve to never throw spears again.
1,Poor Quality Control,"The mortiser's table was misdrilled causing 1) the table to be ""twisted"" aboout 5 degrees, 2)the stop rod hit the base in an uneven location causing inconsistent depth stop. Variation about 1/4"". The flat spot on the fence's support rod was not aligned at 90 degrees to the fence, so that when you tighten the allen bolt the fence tilted about 10 degrees. Very weak Quality control, in my opinion. I returned the item after one mortise."
1,it makes numeric sense,"i had the pain to use this book for my undergrad. coursework for a 200 level class at Cal Poly. Contrary to the other reviewers, i believe the exercises are mediocre, and the material presented lack depth to provide a solid grounding to numerical analysis. Codes are inconveniently written in fortran-97? instead of the more readable pseudo-code. It may provide a good application supplementary for engineering students, but i strongly advise against it for mathematics undergrads. No fun. Lots of handwaving and smoking mirrors."
2,Best movie of the year!,"Gangs of New York is one of those rare films that grows on you after seeing it, the more time passes and the more you think about it. Like lots of movies, I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, but unlike most, my opinion of the movie has grown with reflection. The story, script and acting are all top notch, and the 19th century urban American setting is a virtually untouched goldmine of dramatic potential. Destined to become a classic."
2,L.A's finest with LA COLLECTION of hits!!,"This EP is tight, both lyrically and production wise, from start to finish. If anything its probably the best DEFARI release because all 6 songs are 100% dope, no filler allowed!! Lyrically he's at his pinnacle with some very intelligent, witty and purposeful rhymes. Defari always says something you're glad you heard+makes you want to hear more everytime. The beats here are all on point, with production credits going Joey Chavez, Evidence and Babu in equal measure. The standouts are every last track, particularly ""Smack Ya Face"" and ""I Can't Wait"", 2 of the finest Defari has dropped over his entire career. A must have for any LIKWIT/DEFARI fan but at that price you may have to be a diehard. Excellent EP."
2,Perfect strangers is great,"I've been typing in perfect strangers on amazon for a while now, not really expecting anything because it wasn't a huge show, but then one day i tried it again and the first two seasons where on dvd. I had to get it straight away hoping it was as funny as i remembered. And it was, Bronson Pinchot and Mark Linn-Baker are so good at what they do, they were a perfect team. I loved watching Balki and cousin Larry doing there thing, and if you loved them its a must get. Now time to sit back and hope more of perfect strangers came out on dvd. fingers crossed."
2,MUCH better than the 1960s film!,"This 1995 version stays MUCH truer to the original musical than the 1960s version with Dick Van Dyke. The old film cuts out almost all of the songs, drastically changes some plot points, and is just awkward overall.This version, however, flows nicely, keeps almost all of the original songs, and works in a couple of song substitutions that still work well. Vanessa Williams and Jason Alexander make a great Rosie and Albert. Chynna Phillips is odd as Kim McAfee, but I bet they cast her on purpose to attach another 'name' to it.Wish the soundtrack was available somewhere!"
2,The Blockbuster Romance Novel of the Century,"Dear Readers of Love, I must agree with all who say that this is the best love novel since Romeo and Juliet. It beats the romance between Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater by 5 inches! Paul Richardson deserved more of Julie's time and love than Zack did. By showing what true love is to him and to value family, Julie has not only turned Zack's world upside down, she also reinvented his heart. Ms. McNaught once again makes her emotional trademark in her books. Although I could not understand how they could have fallen in love after 5 years of imprisonment for Zack and spending time alone together in a snowbound cabin, the love story surely hit off right."
1,Didn't work so it went back.,"This was my first experience with a code reader and it was my luck to get a defective one. It kept reading ERROR and would not finish searching for codes despite repeated attempts, so I sent it back, which Amazon made super easy by the way. Maybe they tried to build it too cheaply or something. However, the company has a really good reputation so I gave them another try and ordered the advanced model 3100."
2,A helpful basic marketing book,"I have worked in marketing for many years and bought this book when I first started working in a marketing job. It was a refresher book for me after the marketing education I received. In general, this is a good basic ""what is marketing?"" book that I would recommend to a non-marketing person who wants to learn about marketing or else to someone who's just begun working in a marketing role."
2,Love this!!!!,I have been making pasta everyday now because it's so easy to use and amazing ! life savor ! does everything for you. Easy to clean. Easy to use. Love kitchen aid appliances !
1,BORING READ,"If anyone looks at my review history, they'd find I'm highlycritical of most books. Why? For $20 I expect a good read.I latched onto Bernhardt with ""Murder One,"" and even boughtsome of his previous books, therefore, i was looking forwardto this one. Almost every character in this book isdysfunctional, it was like watching the movie ""TheTannenbaums."" Definitely not a page turner, not evensuspenseful. Come home W.B., and live up to your potential."
2,Top 3 Fav Stand Up of all Time!,"What can I say? Stand up comedy really hit a new high when Chapelle did this. Killin' Them Softly is probably rated in the top 5 in most places. Anyways, enough gushing - just watch it!"
2,Knitting Answer Book,"This is a great little book which really does have all the answers - even answers to questions I hadn't thought of asking. I have recommended the purchase of this book to a number of other kntting friends, all of whom consider it one of the best of its type. A good purchase."
2,The best I've ever read.,"When I was eight, I read this book for the first time. I read Knee-Deep in Thunder at least twice a year for the next ten years. Then the library closed down and sold off all their books. I don't know where this book went, but I missed it. For two years.Majesty, tragedy, myth, beauty, friendship and the eternal human search for meaning in a world gone mad power this book with an energy that I've never found elsewhere.A cast of bugs, accompanied by two ragtag young people, shouldn't feel as real as this does, but each character somehow rings true. If you have not read this book, you are missings out on a real experience.""How many a man has measured a new passage in his life from the reading of a good book. -Henry David Thoreau"
2,Side Comb,I am very pleased with this purchase and am on my way to having quite the collection of France Luxe hair pins and combs.
2,Most Accurate Movie Ever,Everybody should watch this movie it is an enlightening accurate depiction of the facts surrounding Kennedy's Assassination with a companion published book of sources it is certainly the most historically accurate film hollywood has come out with to date.
1,Long & BORING,"Not really SiFi. Fiction and Apocalyptic yes, but after a very few chapters to grab your interest, author drifts off into non-related daydreaming, repetition and his personal philosophy on various character's lives. I'm betting that he was a self proclaimed authority and certainly a pipe smoker.No science, little innovation, but it goes on and on. You keep hoping it will get better, but unfortunately, it doesn't. How it won any award remains a mystery to me. If you are looking for an exciting science fiction work, sorry, but this isn't it."
1,Doesn't play nice with Vista,"If you've got a wired all XP professional network, then it works fine, however don't add a vista laptop with a wireless connection to the mix it is just one big headache. Went back & forth with tech support and when I finally gave up and said that when I didn't use NM to manage the connection, everything went fine...their response was Great glad that things are working for you."
2,Does a good job but hard to read in sunlight,"This tester worked fine on my electric fence. It seemed to give accurate readings and was very easy to use. As others probably mentioned though, it is hard to see the indicator lights in bright sunlight. I'd also only purchase this tester if you intend to store it indoors as it is not the sturdiest tool and may rust if left out in a barn."
2,Where's the truth?,"Presumed Guilty seeks true justice. We want the real person to be punished for these dispicable acts. If it's Scott, then let him pay. If not, let's find the real killer or killers. Matt Dalton's book makes me question the handling of the Petersen case. Where was his defense team? At some point, I'd like to see a face off between Geragos and Dalton on a CNN or Court TV show. An unbiased moderator (unlike Nancy Grace) asking questions as in presidential campaign debates could prove beneficial. Let's do it quickly so Laci's family can enjoy whatever peace they can. Finally, can we put Amber back in the closet? She's received far too much press for her importance in this case. We know Scott cheated, said things men do when trying to coerce a female to have sex with them. Let's explore real evidence and execute the killer or killers."
1,2 GB Memory card,"It works great in the camera, but when I put it in my laptop to download the pictures, it tells me I have to format it. I don't know why, but it is annoying. SO I have a bunch of pictures that I cannot download to my computer."
2,"""The Practical Manual Of The Markets And Trading It.",This is a practical manual which can be applied right in the middle of the market hours.There are no theoretical concepts as preached by theoretical gurus today. This is a book on the subtle distinctions made on the price behaviour of stocks and the markets besides the psychology and belief systems a speculator/trader must possess in order to succed.A must read for those willing to improve their trading performances.
1,More than a bowel movement,"This album is like a whole truck of chunky poo! I don't know why I bought this album, afterwards I was so ashamed that I let my dog chew it up. All the over production of Prog Rock without any concept, the worst of both worlds! Do not buy this album it will destroy your musical soul!"
1,absolutly uninspiring!,"this is NOT the original johann strauss orchestra - what a cheat!!!compare horrible andre rieu recordings and cheap entertainment with the wonderful timeless recordings of the original vienna johann strauss orchestra.The Vienna Johann Strauss Orchestra: Edition 4, Manuscripts - Conductor: Franz Bauer-Theussldont go for this release - there are wonderful releases available from the vienna philharmonic orchestra and the original vienna johanns trauss orchestra - god knows why this release appears first, it is totally uninspiring ..."
1,Legal Action for a defective product?,"Hello, I've had the same problem with this tv. The blue blotches and the yellow discoloration. My warranty did expire though Zenith did say they would cover the 2500 dollar part. That's nice and all, but I assume they are using the same parts that these tvs were initially built with. I expect it will work for about another year or so until I'm faced with having to shell out all that money to have it fixed again. I'm wondering if any legal action can be taken against Zenith/LG for manufacturing and selling a defective product? Perhaps it falls under some kind of product liability law? I Just want my money back and I'll be satisfied!!!"
2,Good cable,Needed a shorter cable to hook things up around the TV to a router. Cable is good quality and works perfectly fine.
2,"The Stone Arrow, by Richard Herley","This book was a good read. Maybe not exactly what I expected, but it was interesting, and the price was right."
1,Dorman 49444 HELP! Wiper Linkage Clip Kit,THIS ITEM WAS NOT WHAT WAS IN THE PHOTO AND WAS NOT WHAT I ORDERED..I RE ORDERED THIS ITEM AND AGAIN I RECIEVED THE WRONG PART SO I WENT TO THE LOCAL DODGE DEALER AND PICKED UP A SET FOR LESS $$$..
1,Look closely at author's sources...,I read this book for a historiography class in college - the prof's entire intention was to show us budding historians what not to do. Bellesiles has either falsified some of his sources or had access to sources that do not appear to exist and which he himself cannot remember. This resulted in the loss of his position at Emory Univ. and the withdrawl of his Bancroft Prize from Columbia University...just thought people should know.
1,i refuse to buy this,i went to an artist concert in sept of 1998 i was so bored hearing doug fresh rap larry singing sly stone songs prince needs to go old school get back to the funk artist....im tried of maxwell singing your songs .........
2,A keeper!,If you enjoy learning about the characters of the Old West you'll really enjoy this book! I'd recommend keeping this book for future generations.
2,Platonic blue tooth,I bought this item for my husband. I had bought the same item from a retail cell phone company store and paid twice as much. It works great and came in the same original package that it did when I purchased it in the store.
1,Adequate,"Read The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle instead. Murakami's latest novel is certainly readable, in the sense that a very cheap wine is ""drinkable"", but it is also bottomlessly self-indulgent. Murakami writes very well, but he is not writing about much of anything in Kafka on the Shore. Empty and dull."
2,Very Useful,"I find this book very useful, I have lots of flowers and vegetation in general in my garden, and this has given me a great guideline to creating more beautiful flower arrangements in my house, I feel much more confident about my arrangements and about trying different things. If you are a beginner like I am, this is a wonderful book, I bought this toghether with Judith Blacklock's ""Flower Design"" and found that they both complement each other very well. Am very pleased with my purchase."
2,a treasure in paperback,"I have now owned 2 copies of this book, and recently purchased another copy to gift to my son for his birthday. The book is more than a guide to preserving, etc. It is also a glimpse into the past when times seemed more simple, and people were equipped to survive with what they could grow in their gardens, and make from their crops. Many of the recipes (home made cider, soap, cheese, etc) come with directions on how to build the pieces of equipment to make the product. This book comes with directions to revive many lost arts...it would be a wonderful gift for anyone who is interested in becoming as self-sufficient as one wants to be."
2,Best Bread Machine Ever!,"I have never owned a bread machine and I am just getting into baking bread in general. I thought it would be great to make homemade bread instead of buying it from the store, though, so my husband bought me this. I received it for Christmas and made bread that day because I was so excited! It did take me a couple of loaves to get it right (I think it was because I was using cold water instead of warm, so the yeast wasn't reacting like it should), but I finally got the hang of it! I love that the screen is on the front instead of on the top, and it is super easy to figure out. Even though it has only been a couple of weeks, I've made about 5 or six loaves of bread and LOVE IT!"
2,"Before Shackleton, there was Riley",This is a fine entry into the literature of true adventure stories and the literature of suffering. The jacket notes indicate this volume was very popular in the early 19th century and influenced a young Abraham Lincoln. I am surprised that this book does not enjoy wider fame.
2,Fun and simple to teach the message,A friend recommended this book to help remind kids or situations and how they should react in the Christ like fashion. It has been a great learning tool for my younger two children. Very simplistic at times but the kids and I do enjoy it.
1,Nothing to do with Watch on the Rhine,"A reviewer says that this movie is based on Watch on the Rhine--not so. (That's a play by Lillian Hellman.) This movie is based, as the other reviews indicate, on The Maltese Falcon. However, the reviewer who made that mistake is otherwise correct--it's a very disappointing movie. In fact, it's puzzling why anyone would take Hammet's The Maltese Falcon and do this tepid waste."
1,Sent me a damaged USED battery - No response to refund request,"I purchased a NEW battery from this company, but instead they sent me a USED battery with 37 charge cycles."
1,"Predictable, unrealistic, not worth the money",This movie was incredibly predictable and typical Hollywood. Some of the gore thrown in to the movie seemed to be placed there to shock people so that they would stay awake. Instead it was just gross. For people who don't like much thought put into movies and pretty faces well then you'll love this movie. Otherwise it's not worth the money.
2,B.O.C. at their best,"This is not only the bands best work but one of he best rock albums ever. I have never tired of it. Opening with Career of Evil and closing with the classic Astronomy, this rocks all the way through. Every song a gem. I love this band, and have bought abot 80% of their work, but this is the one that defines this great band."
2,demo worth the big download,"This is cool because it is also for Mac. I have only played the demo, available from the LucasLearning site. It was very impressive, with a high degree of replay. The graphics, utilizing the Mac's built-in 3D card, were very impressive. It was fun to make different droids and see how they react in different circumstances."
1,ONE STAR FOR THIS POINTLESS RELEASE.....5 STARS FOR THE FILM THOUGH!!!,"No doubt ""the emperor's new groove"" is by far a great entertainer and one of the best animated films to come out of disney studios but do you actually need another edition of the dvd when two different editions are already available? One being a single disc and the other one being a 2disc collector's edition. Again another single disc release for the same film doesnt make any sense to me. Moreover they havent even cut down the price this time or improved on any bonus materials on the disc.I just dont get disney and buena vista's strange ways. They'll keep classics like ""beauty and the beast"", ""snow white"" etc in vaults for years and keep on releasing stuff which is already in stores everywhere.This is not a review of the film ""the emperor's new groove"" which definitely deserves 5 stars in any case!!"
2,Marvelous Edition!,"I loved Troy the theatrical cut and absolutely love this new director's cut. It's more passionate, more blood, more power, more love, more everything. It looks and sounds absolutely stunning with 1080p/VC-1 video and Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio. Beautiful crisp picture quality, a must for anyone's HD DVD collection. I highly recommend this epic motion picture."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this box set because of all the major Brazilian stars featured in the set. I have a pretty extensive Brazilian collection, and I hoped this would fill in for some stars that I do not have in my collection. But it was not what I hoped for, the stars are there but they are not singing any of their good stuff, and many of the tracks feature multiple singers, like if they were singing for a fund raiser. The few good tunes that are in this collection don't justify the price."
1,Hideously boring,"This may be an interesting historical story, but, it needs to be condensed to about 20 min. No dramatic tension, pacing that would make Russian directors happy. Basically, a very long high school history class movie that, while perhaps historically acurate, makes you long for the buzzer."
1,NOT CRAZY ABOUT THIS BOOK,"I'm not Jewish and I don't know Yiddish at all. Apparently, unless you have one or both of those qualifications, you may not like this book. I've gotten far in the book but I'm waiting still to like the story or for something to happen to make me understand all the good reviews. Seeing Mr. Chabon's tight smile on the book insert at the end seems to be trying to reassure that it will get better but I think it won't. I am leaving a bad review b/c I think I know at this point that I will never get into the book although I understand the basic story but can't get any enjoyment out of it since I don't understand what they're really saying."
1,Jesus & the riddle of the dead sea scrolls,"Book is a straight copy of Jesus the Man, which I bought 6 months ago."
2,Good Writing Never Fails,"It is hard to improve on Bradbury writings and fun to see the early evolution of Bradbury stories like the Martian Chronicles. This TV series, though it cannot meet the HD quality of today's show, does not let one disappointed. It is worth the cost!"
1,Your $$$ could be better spent...,"Based on: 1) my reading of the Amazon-presented exerpts from the book (including the reviews); 2) my personal knowledge of dealing with the author, in past years, on a book-related discussion board, and 3) allegations recently made on that same discussion board, by several people, of certain irregularities regarding the author's cancellation of a book fair and (lack of) return of deposits paid, I cannot recommend this book."
2,classic soul,i am big fan of will downing. I can't say for anyone else but his music is relaxing and I love it.
2,Excellent Service!!,I have had the Vonage service for about a month over my cable modemservice from Optimum online and it is clear and works as well as my prior telephone line from Verizon. It has saved me nearly 75$ per month from my prior bills. They also now have 911 service! I would highly recommend you try the service... BTW their customer service depatment was very helpful as well.
2,The Best......,"I have been using this cleaner/wax for about 20 years. I have tried many others, but I keep coming back to this over and over again. And it smells good too!!"
2,Charming book about a charming (if a bit noisy) subject,"This is one of the finest pet books ever written; it doesn't sound ""canned,"" as so many books on pet care do. The author's enthusiasm for these most enthusiastic of pets comes through. He gives enough anecdotal information to hold the reader's interest but backs it up with solid facts and how-to's on the care, taming, training and breeding of halfmoon conures. For instance, he is very honest about the noise factor: dwarf parrots of all species can be raucous! The chapter on other popular dwarf parrots is necessarily abbreviated but informative enough to ""do"" until the reader could find a book on his particular pet. (Bates and Busenbark's PARROTS AND RELATED BIRDS, recommended in this book, would be an excellent choice for that reader). All in all, a delightful read."
1,disappointed again,It appears that this series is going the way of many fantasy series and that Mr Goodkind has once again made the fatal flaw of many a fantasy writer - it is important to finish a series before the series becomes boring. Having read all the books and been entertained by the earlier books I was disappointed by the content and the style of Faith of the Fallen. I think my feelings can be summed up a section which suggested that Richard and Kahlan had only met a year ago - it felt reading this book that we had suffered each minute with them. The book accurately reflects torture by a Mord Sith.
2,Interesting setting,The setting and description of Tibet was the most interesting aspect of this book. It is a generally exciting murder mystery - like all murder mysteries are - though sometimes there were too many details to keep track of which could make it slightly confusing.
1,Little Improvement to a VERY poor product,"Yet another buggy and less-than-average program by Roxio.This version fixes a few of the many flaws in the last version but nowhere near enough to justify using this product over MS Digital Image, Adobe Photoshop Elements, JASC PaintShop, etc.I wish that I had never purchased this product. DO NOT use the one-touch photo doctor! It oversharpens your photos and they come out looking very poor!"
2,Expectations met!,"Wonderful from office meetings to 4-H meetings! I'll never have to worry that there is enough coffee at family holiday gatherings or enough hot water for kids' hot chocolate. In the long run, it's worth the price (which, by the way, is much less for my purchase than I found at other places for the same item at this time)."
1,minus 5 stars!,"So much for the ""100% NO-RISK Quality Guarantee!"" My printer (which is listed as compatible on the box) does not recognize the cartridge, and, there is no answer at their 1-866 number."
1,Sugar Free Assorted Fruit Gummy Bears,The sender did a lousy job.Came in a flat envelope and candies were mashed into a lup.Shipping was too expensive for this mess.I live in Florida so maybe the temp. had something to do with the clumping.
1,Terribly boring,"The history and culture of Central America is so fascinating, and I learned so much from studying abroad in Belize and Guatemala this summer, but I could not get through this book. The writing is dry and fails to present the ideas in a coherent and exciting way. The book is weighted down by its heavy historical sections, which are written much like a grade school textbook, not in the elegant and engaging style of great writers like Sherry Ortner. Don't get me wrong...I love history, especially this particular topic. But despite its title, this book fails to emphasize the dynamics of the rich history and mixed culture of Central America and display those dynamics to the reader."
1,Not What I Expected.......,"Maybe it was the writer's fault, but this story just wasn't presented the way I thought it would be. It turned out to be more of a travelogue of this little neighborhood than individual stories about the ladies themselves. I couldn't finish it."
1,It's not a lift the flap book.,I purchased this book because I had read the hard cover and thought a lift the flap version would be interesting. I still really like the story but this is a very poor rendition of a lift the flap format.
1,Left Me Cold,"It's so fascinating to read reviews by ordinary readers like all of us, not literary reviews. Human nature is so diverse. The latest edition of The New Yorker gave a very favorable review of this book. But for me, I don't know that this was the worst book I've read in the last few months, but it came close. I couldn't have been less interested in the characters, the subject matter, the location - the whole book left me cold. I have read comparisons to Gilead - a wonderful book. Abide with Me is not in the same league, not even playing the same game."
1,Mr Bell A wolf in sheeps clothing bewaire,Please ask God for understanding of the word and not man. Man can twist and send the wrong message. God Bless
1,horrible,"I can't even believe this crap is in stores. My homegirl rented it and it put me to sleep, and when I woke up, I didn't feel lost on the ""plot"" because the whole thing was just plain dumb. I was so mad she made me sit and watch the whole movie like it was gonna get any better. I expected more out of Katt because I love his stand-up but this and It's Pimpin Pimpin are HUGE disappointments."
1,save your money,"A long-time, diehard Stoner, I bought this because (probably like a lot of others) I never fully replaced all my great old Stones albums with their CD successors, and missed a few of the old songs, especially cornball novelties like ""Fool to Cry"" and ""Hot Stuff,"" from the great ""Black and Blue"" album. Needless to say, I was greatly disappointed to find many of the songs edited and cut down. Why? I could understand in the vinyl days when you had x-amount of capacity on one side of a disc, but in the digital age there's no excuse for hacking off parts of these great songs. A less monumental annoyance: I can't explain why but the thing won't play in the iMac I have at work. I've played hundreds of discs on it with no problem but it keeps spitting out ""Jump Back"" and refusing to play. (Maybe the iMac doesn't like edited versions either.) I haven't had this problem with ""Jump Back"" on my PC at home, the car CD player, or my regular stereo, just on the iMac."
2,The Bishop's Wife,"One of my favorite Christmas movies, I have watched it every year. Still a classic film with a wonderful cast. They can remake it over and over this will always be my favorite"
2,Great Styling Tool!!,"Am African-Amer. w/ frizzy, unruly hair that easy puffs in humid weather. After tryin multiple irons, I find this to be the only one giving long lasting results. The Sedu is over-rated as my hair puffed one humid,rainy am after using it the previous night. Also,a bit heavier than the typical flat iron, but I got used to handling it. As for some customers complaining of the hair loss, it is typical to lose 50 hairs per day from everyday grooming. Also, if you use the steaming function before gliding down the hair this soften the hair minimizing any hairs that are loss. All in all, I am satisfied with the product and the pros far outway the cons and would recommend purchasing at 100%"
2,Great!,I'm not sure I can understand the complaints about this novel. It was one of my favourite Koontz books yet. This particular book was especially good escape reading. A real thriller. The writing was good. The plot was entertaining. The characters were colourful. I enjoyed it.
1,"Good movie, bad music.","The movie is good, has nice action scenes, the terrorists are bad but not as bad as the real ones (well this is a pre 9/11 movie) so I could give this movie 3 stars; however, the music is horrendous, it sound as a Saturday morning GI Joe cartoon. It makes you not to care for the characters because it reminds you that it's just all fictional and that the good guys are going to end up killing the bad guys and there is not tension in it. If this type of music wouldn't be in the movie, or even if there would be no music at all, it would be better. The director should have put this music only at the end credits, that's it. So because of this music, and being generous, I give this movie two stars.Alan Sylvestri is a good composer but I think, this is one of his worst jobs."
2,Neat Product,"I added these as stripes to our office space and I was able to accomplish just the look I was going for (retro chic). The colors are fun and added some zest to our light grey walls. It was my first time using wall-pops so it took me a minute to get the hang of hanging them. The best part is that they are removable and can be reapplied over and over, so the product was very flexible with my beginner status. I am so glad I purchased them and will definitely be using them again. My fiancé also really likes our office and said we should use them in more rooms of our house!"
1,"It was good, when it wasn't disconnected.",Had this router for about 3yrs. Past year or so been disconnecting like crazy. Can't connect to more then a couple devices at once without dropping. The speed is great...just d/c's too much.
2,Probably the best golf DVD there is,"Finally a made for DVD golf instructional. Simon Holmes is a real trainer and coach - and it shows. This is not about ""once-in-a-million"" shots by some pro that are impossible for anybody else to do but about solid instruction for all level of players. With over two hours on the DVD the different segments (e.g. the Swing) are systematically developed and presented. The DVD navigation also allows you to go directly to all relevant areas, for example Impact drills for slicers or Controlling distance in bunker shots. This is a DVD that you'll come back to many times."
1,I gave up,"I had the feeling there must be some suplimentary material I was missing while trying to read this book. Alot of ideas that had no explanation. Basically I gave up trying make use of this book.It has some of the usual stuff included in books on this subject, like instrument ranges. For me, there were just too many ideas without a clue as to HOW to do it. You might as well say ""try to make good sounding songs"" ""try to keep your melodies interesting"" ""use discipline, and good judgment in your arrangment"". If you are a fan of this style of advice and teaching, then you will love this book."
2,"I'm not even a Gloria EsteFAN, but this is a knockout!","Your neighbors will hate you, but play this LOUD! Not just a system show-off, but a system ""stress test"". Great songs, one after the other and spectacular dynamics and production. Another no-brainer!"
1,Not what I expected,"Being die-hard Matchbox 20 fans, we were pretty excited to hear this CD, unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. I guess there is not much you can do with a quartet, I thought the arrangements sounded ""cheesy""--we laughed at how bad it was."
2,great adaptet,"great tool, now i can convert all of the vhs tapes of my kids growing up and all their activities to dvd."
1,Difficult to return an item,Had a hard time getting a refund...they kept pushing exchanging the item even though I specifically wanted a refund. Finally made it happen after insisting. Should never be that difficult.
2,evil genius project books,I received my book (Electronic Sensors for the Evil Genius:54 electrifiying projects)within 2 weeks of the purchase date and in good condition. I am looking forward to making some of the projects .ThanksJHamm
2,4-way splitter is not included,"The ""green thumb"" version of this product does not include the 4-way splitter valve which costs about 15 bucks by itself. I found this system at Home Depot with the 4-way splitter for less money than this one, and that's before shipping of 6 bucks is added. So far I've been happy with all of the Orbit brand timers I've bought, just realize that this version lacks the 4-way splitter."
2,"product is a little wobbly, but still a good stand","this product is a bit wobbly, but for the price, it can't be beat. there is a safety strap for the neck of the guitar. and it is light and easy to move. would buy again."
2,Organize your pantry at last...,"I bought this for my disorganized daughter for her pantry. It is much sturdier than the cheaper ones I'd seen and holds a lot. It is bigger than I'd realized, so she had to remove one small shelf in her cabinet, but it holds and organizes enough cans that it still holds more than she was able to put in the area before. She loves it so much that I'm thinking about getting one for myself and my other daughter (though this time I'll measure her full one to be sure it will fit where I want it)."
2,review for shrek all the story,"Very nice for amazon, good prices and fast shipping, the movies are great and of course in blu ray is the best quality, thanks again"
2,bargain kitchen tool.,"It's just like a Microplane(tm): a kitchen version of a wood-rasp. It just plane (pardon the pun) works. But I take issue with the construction. They cut a corner by making the handle hollow. I appreciate the attempt to make the handle larger and more ergonomic, but it should have been solid. The hollowness throws off the balance and feels cheap in the hand. So, aside from feeling like a cheap toy, it zests and grates with the best of them."
2,Marduk's Tablet,Excellent novel and fast paced. Biblical adventure with Babylonian historical background that parallels with the book of Daniel. Modern detective story with a bit of history. Excellent
2,Good for electric stoves,"I have an electric stove, so the wide bottom of the Mia works great with burners that are much larger than most stove top espresso makers. I use this almost daily. My only complaint is that the top half is a little hard to clean. Since it's all stainless (including the handle) it's dishwasher safe, which I need to do about once a month."
1,Great Movies on Terrible DVDs--Don't Buy!,"Unlike the other Hitchcock collections I own (Masterpiece and Signature), the packaging on this set is terrible: the plastic/acrylic case cracked almost immediately without any real pressure (i.e., opening it should not cause the case to crack along an entire edge), and although the binder of DVD slip covers is nice-looking, it's not particularly practical in terms of preventing the discs from being scratched (and I'm really careful with this sort of thing). But the worst part of this product is that the DVDs do not play. We tried watching _Rebecca_, one of my favorites, only to find that the entire movie just skips and jumps and hesitates and then doesn't play at all. It's terribly frustrating! And it turns out it's not a one-disc problem; it's several discs. So don't bother with this collection; it's a waste of money, and it ruins the Hitchcock experience!"
2,A must read every night,We have read this book so many times I have it memorized. I have to recite it every night right before putting my daughter down for the night. It seems to help soothe her and she knows it's time to go to bed. The story is a little silly and doesn't make sense but I don't argue with what she likes.
2,Just watched,Watched this once for before completing my first workout--don't let this quiet workout fool you it is tough. My legs and core were shaking when I was through. I look forward to incorporating this into my routine.
1,NaviGONE!,"I bought my Navigon a little over a year ago. It's performance has been mixed, in line with much of the reviews here. However, I can now unequivocally state that you should NOT buy this product. Navigon has abruptly left the North American market, leaving customers, even those who purchased a device and map updates within the year, almost completely without support. If you buy one of these, you're buying a dead device with no hope of updates."
2,Video study guide,This was a big help understanding the basics. i could use the video for review. I only wish this came on DVD.
1,ADL Approved book,"The plastic man is a fraud. He pushes the same lies as the Jewish media: that ""Jews are against xians."" - The same lies that were inserted into the talmud to fool Gentile humanity. Another thing about Duke, if he's so ""racially aware"" then why would he have SO MANY plastic surgery procedures done? Plastic surgery would only cover up a persons true racial features. The answer becomes pretty clear when you look at Dukes older photos."
2,Excellent Tool for Programmers !,"In spite of being an advanced book, difficult concepts are explained clearly and in a very simple way.You can find a lot of advices on best practices throughout the book as well as very powerful techniques that are really useful while you develop your applications.For an advanced VBA programmer, this book is a must."
2,"A zany delight, well ahead of it's time.","A collection of opinions on random words listed alphabetically published in 1962.....sounds pretty dry....but with the sharpwitted Miss Dietrich behind those thoughts, this book is nothing less than utterly brilliant...and at times funnier than all those played out latenight jokesters rolled together. The legendary glamour queen's absolutely straightforward (and seemingly spontaneous) responses go from dull, peculiar, strangely personal and highly sentimental to outright wacky and some so outrageously funny (and seriously honest) , you'll be quoting her frequently! A perfect book for roadtrips and for fueling a party that's losing it's fizz."
2,Excitable Boy,This was my first Warren Zevon vinyl album many years ago. Wore the record out so got the CD and am very pleased with being able to hear my old favorites again.
2,The Real Deal Has Arrived!,"The traditional country sound that's been absent from music row for so many years now has re-emerged. And every once in a while, a great while, I come across a singer whose album is just loaded top to bottom with great songs, any one of them potential hits. I give Darryl 5 stars on his successful attempt at finally bringing us some of what I call ""real country music."" His first single, ""Second Wind,"" with its gliding steel guitar in the background is one of the prettiest, most brilliantly written songs heard in quite some time. The traditional melodies continue with ""Is It Just Us,"" and ""Those Less Fortunate Than I,"" to name just a few. Upbeat down-home licks include his hits, ""A Good Day To Run"" and ""Sideways,"" all demonstrating his blue-collar, country soul. Folks, this aint no Shania Twain or Toby Keith here. This is REAL country music, ""Hag"" style!"
1,only used it once,got this for my husbands smoker/grill and should of listened to the reviews. it is not long enough and had to go to home depot to get a homemade part. the thing only worked the one time and we haven't used it since.
2,1000 stars,"If you're a heavy metal fan, you have every right to feel ashamed for not owning this record. Refused f-ing rock! This is such a slamming, grooving, neck-snapping record, it's hard to properly describe it. I can't heap enough praise on it, it's brilliant! I truly wish this WAS the shape of punk to come! I'd guess that if you like old NYC hardcore, post-punk stuff like Minor Threat and At The Drive In, then you have every reason to LOVE this LP. You'll spin this thousands of times before ever getting tired of it."
1,Terrible,I collect werewolf movies and own over 15 of them. Darkwolf is by far the worst I own. Do not buy this movie.
1,Total Lack of Interest,I really did not enjoy this book. I found the characters to be completely unlikable. I never became vaguely interested in their constant misery and self absorption.
1,What the hell is this???,"Dear God, what the hell has music become?!? I never thought I would long for the boy bands of the late 90s, but just when you thought pop music couldn't get any worse, the music industry loves to surprise us with another talentless hack.Seriously, anyone rating this above 1 star (in which I feel is quite generous for this pile of puke) should learn to listen to the words. If that is impossible (possibly because in this case, it's too painful), Google them up. This girl must have had more alcohol in her than Bon Scott and John Bonham combined to write something so rediculous and terrible.Seeing how this pile was released a month ago, and is already out of the Top 50 (assuming it even charted that high), gives me hope that people still have some slight tastes in music... for now... :("
2,Very Pretty,"I bought these for something a little funky for weekends and elegant for evenings out. They are perfect for both. After a month, they aren't tarnishing and look exactly the same. Well worth the price."
1,Potential Lost,"This book has the makings of a brilliant WWII techno-thriller with personable characters and a fairly well thought out plot. Sadly the story loses momentum and the characters take on a very stylized formula which muddles the plot and becomes preditcable. It doesn't seem like the author did much research before undertaking this work, either on biological warfare or Nazi Germany. It is interesting reading, but had much more potential."
1,Could not believe how heavy the wand is and how awkward to use.,I am handicaped and ordered this machine for me to use. We already own the animal one and love it but I can not use it with my breathing. I thought this canister one I could pull around and would not be that hard to use. It is heavier to try to use than the animal and the wand is so awkward to try to dust with and also extremely heavy. It cleaned beautifully but could not use it myself. I returned this one and bought the new slim 18 model and I can at least use it. Dyson need to redesign this one so it would not be so heavy in the wand and the floor attachment.
1,Poor quality product,"The battery was dead on this watch when I received it. After replacing it, the watch functioned for perhaps a month on the new battery before drastically losing time. This is a poor quality product than I can't recommend."
2,Mylar,Effective way to conserve body heat as a last resort. Many other uses for the mylar such as a signal or use for a solar oven. It arrived on time and it perfect condition.
1,Only one use,I used this pan one time before it broke. The latch used to tighten it bent because the side grooves wouldn't slide over the bottom piece smoothly. Now the pan won't close at all. A waste of money.
1,Not a C programmer? Move on...,"This book is a detailed, difficult to follow textbook that covers the software Codewarrier Lite. As it states in the beginning... if you've never written C code, buy a textbook on that language, then come back and read this book. Overall thumbs down..."
1,Not worth it,"I just finished reading the whole book and wanted to see how it came out on the screen.Honestly, I have painfully gone through half of the movie and ended it there.The story line of the book and the movie could not have been further apart. Story line has flown very nicely from one clue to another. In the movie it jumps all over the place and some key moment (im my personal opinion key moments) has been completely changed.You may want to try to give it a shot only if it is free. But I would no recommend it even for free just so you would not ruin what your own imagination created while reading the book. You can bet it is far better than this movie."
1,there are far better options,"I bought this for a recent trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park. I was immediately struck by the number of typos and outright errors, the strange organization of the maps, and the inclusion of arbitrary and useless ""helpful facts"" on each page. I'm used to a pretty high standard of road atlas from Frommer's or Michelin, and this is nowhere close.On our first day in South Africa, we were able to find far superior road atlases. The best was the road atlas published by AA, South Africa's version of AAA; also good was the MapStudio road atlas. Both will serve you far better if you're interested in such minor details as roads, cities, and distances."
1,Should be called: REALbad throughout,"Out of curiousity, I read through enough of this book in Borders to see that it's in right in line with the [lack of] quality I expect from Charles River Media. Anyone who's mistakenly purchased any book from this publisher already knows what a waste of trees their books are, and now so do you. I give this 1 star because the pull-down menu doesn't have an option for no star at all.If you're already a crack programmer in some language (any at all), get Matt Neuburg's book (O'Reilly). If you're more of a novice to application programming, start with Erick's For Dummies book."
1,Wha-?,Unbelievably stupid & disorganized.We stopped the movie about 35-40 mins in.I can't remember the last time my family and I couldn't finish a movie--highly rare.
2,"Good Story, Fast Read","This book's story was a little strange, but also good. I found it interesting that Rosie's best friend, Bailey, was blind. Bailey did pretty much everything a normal kid would do. I also liked how the title fit the story so well. It was weird how the time changed from the present to when Granny Torrelli was little and how everything that happened to Granny Torrelli when she was young happened to Rosie. It was a fast read and I liked the way Granny Torrelli talked. She used interesting Italian phrases."
2,I used to eat this when I was a kid,"I know it's expensive (especially price to weight ratio), but it actually costs less now than it did 20 years ago. I remember paying over $3 for it back then. And it still costs about $3 (I wish I could still buy houses and cars at '80s prices).For me, it's a memorable desert I loved (and still do). There's nothing else like it. Oh, and if I'm not mistaken, I think that is the same package design from way back in the day. I haven't seen this brand in ages, so I'm not sure. The only place that has it is a science museum and they carry some other brand now. Is that the Challenger, btw?That's it. I'm ordering some."
1,No response from company,"We purchased one of these earlier in the year. It worked great untill the seat top collapsed and then finaly cracked.Ordered another one as a replacement and found the newer model was a different color. The recently purchased seat lasted only a few weeks and showed defects under the seat, now it is unstable.Item rated not to exceed 350 lbs and wife is far less then that. I think they have used another type of cheap plastic.Called company as required under warranty and still no response.Not worth the moneyJunk"
2,Perfect for Traditional Sit Ups and Similar Exercises,"I bought this to take the discomfort away from doing sit-ups (etc.) on hardwood floors.The padding is ribbed for easy rolling and thick enough to cushion the knob of the lower back at the pelvis.The backing is a little to slippery, so I DO NOT recommend this to be used for stand up stretching a warm-up exercises on a smooth surface although it's fine on carpet.The one thing I like about it is that it has elastic loops to hold it together after it's rolled up and the web handle is an added convenience for carrying or hanging in the closet, etc.I think it's a bargain."
2,Solid thus far,"So far the watch has been great--came with a full charge but I left it in the sun for a few hours each day just tovmake sure it was up to 100%. the light button is in a great spot which I appreciate. The buttons are onset so you have to use your nail to press them but it insures you don't accidentally screw up and set your watch to an incorrect time. It had trouble receiving the time via the radio signal once, but it has successfully done it every other time. I'd buy the watch if I were you!"
1,Leaves much to be desired.,"I was greatly disappointed in this book. I had bought it after reading the first review. I guess I should have waited longer for other reviews.It wasn't funny. The jokes were badly done as well as the writing. I felt this needed more work done to it and more content. I don't know why this was turned into a book. It's more like a short story.Each chapter was a few pages long. There were blank pages that separated each chapter with nothing but a fish on it. I paid for content, for a story. Not blank pages! I was very put out that I spent over ten dollars on this ""book"".I really did not like the writing for this book. I felt it lacked real talent creative and otherwise. I don't believe this author has what it takes to be one of the greats."
1,broke after a few weeks...,"My camera fitted and the case looks OK, but after just a few uses the strap that allows attaching the case to a belt broke at the upper seams, without me noticing. I was lucky that my new camera survived the fall AND that somebody pointed out to me that I'd lost something..."
2,Economically Priced and Written,"Scott Crider's book is a model of economy. Forget expensive books filled with trite essays and flashy pictures, this slender volume is solid meat from beginning to end. Crider moves seamlessly through his chapters on invention, organization, style, and re-vision, constantly cross-referencing his material throughout. The chapter on organization is particularly good, providing practical and well-conceived strategies to escape the limits of the five-paragraph essay. Crider's book produces thoughtful in-class discussion as well, and for that alone, I am thankful."
1,SHRINKS LIKE CRAZY - DO NOT BUY,"I bought two of the pads for a Graco Pack and Play. I made sure to try them to ensure a good fit before washing them and pre-wash they fit perfectly. One cold wash and a tumble dry and they shrunk to the point where they no longer fit and are unusable. They are so small that they make the PNP mattress fold up on itself. A waste of money and I cannot return them now that they have been washed. Not sure what would happen with a cold wash and a line dry, but be warned."
1,too bad there is no 0 star,"Can somebody either shoot him or send him to North Pole or something... He is false representing Hip-Hop with his uncreative lyrics and beat biting; he is a horrible dancer as well (i must mention) Buffy, stop stealing other's beats... and oh, writing your own lyrics helps too. YOU SUCK ! Please, don't buy this CD...this is a CD with bunch of BS songs put together... looking for tru hiphop, go get yourself the new Roots album or any KRS-one classic album... anything but Buff Mommy"
1,lights,"lights stink, ist time used i blew a bulb, not good for water,had to purchase submersible lights, these lights are not sealed for water tight"
2,Go Delta Blues!,I received this CD very promptly and recommend both the seller and the artist to anyone! It's been good exposure to Delta blues-:)
2,great way to carry the baby and to calm him down,"We originally got the Baby Bjorn to carry him around when we are on the move. However, we discovered another use for the BabyBjorn carrier...it's a great way to soothe and calm a crying baby. Whenever our baby cries, we'd put him in the BabyBjorn and carry him around when we do work around the house. He quickly stops his crying and falls asleep."
1,not the best episode,"The world adventure teams Dora with Swiper--that's right, as friends. Their mission is to save ""Friendship Day"" by replacing the bracelets that Swiper had swiped. It is really sad that on a trip around the world they didn't visit ANY country where Spanish is spoken. And what's more, the plot is really boring. Nothing happens that is entertaining or fun for my kid. The songs that Swiper and Dora sing together are LOUSY. Nothing about the songs is catchy or fun.Another odd thing is that Dora's voice is different. It sounds like they couldn't get the same actress they normally use to do Dora's voice. Dora sounds older.There are a lot of fun Dora videos out there but this isn't one of them."
2,Annihilating Guilt,"UNLIKE SOME OF THE REVIEWERS OF THIS BOOK, I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. SCHWARZ GIVES YOU THAT FEELING THAT YOU PERSONALLY KNOW THEESE CHARACTERS. AMANDA ESPECIALLY,BLESS HER HEART. I THOUGHT I HAD EVERYTHING FIGURED OUT. WRONG AGAIN! THE STORY DOES GO BACK AND FORTH, BUT NOT SO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON. IF YOU HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED GUILT, YOU WILL REALLY RELATE TO THIS READ. THE ENDING WAS A COMPLETE SURPRISE! ENJOY!!"
2,The Fearless Man,"One review of this book reads that it does not allow the reader to see and feel what is going on in the combat scenes. I accept that the reviewer felt that. I do agree that the combat scenes get down to basic details that at times become almost too detailed to understand with their stream of data. I disagree with the judgement that this book didn't allow the reader to ""see and feel"". I could see, hear, smell and feel the combat. Admittedly, I was a Marine Corps officer and trained to understand the writer's language. I was struck by the attention to and accuracy of details. If troops moved south on a particular compass heading the written heading was correct. I highly recommend this book. The characters are displayed warts and all in a story that could only have been written by someone who had been there"
1,LOW QUALITY HATE IT PIECE OF TRASH,VERY LOW QUALITY I PAID $15.99 BUT THEY ARE REALLY NOT WORTHED EVEN FOR $1 HATE IT..................... I THREW THEM IN TRASH AFTER WHEN I GOT IT......
2,Date Night DVD,"This movie is great, right up there with ""The Hangover""....(which I still think is the funniest movie) Lot of good lines....Tina Fey and Steve Carell are wonderful."
2,perfect converter -> recommendation,"There is not much to say. I bought this converter because I'm currently in the USA and I wanted to use my devices from Germany. The converter works perfectly and everything's fine. I would recommend it.PS: I'm using the converter to charge my iPhone 3G, my electric tooth-brush and that's it. Again, I'm not using it much, but for what I need it, it's perfect! :)"
1,Do not purchase this book.,"As others have mentioned, there are numerous typos - but the exams in the back of the book were not similar to the exam that I took at all. Although it is strong in helping you strengthen core Algebraic principles, it is not great otherwise.I was extremely disappointed as I falsely believed after mastering the exams that I was ready."
2,Best thing I ordered for school,"This guide got me through organic chem, I only wish I'd bought it earlier in the semester and I might have four-pointed the class. Great idea if you're having a hard time studying by lecture alone. Gives very simple, concise summaries of concepts with lots of examples and diagrams."
1,Just my two cents worth...,"To be perfectly honest, I haven't read the book yet because I sat on and broke my reading glasses but I thought I would pass along some tips that I have picked up over the last 20 or so years. I think that the most important thing that I would say is you should include a good amount of fiber in your diet. ""An apple a day"", really is good advice. Also, lots of vegetables and other sourced of dietary roughage help to keep you regular. Drink plenty of water and if you feel like you're becoming constipated, consider a laxative like Metamuc...Oh... How to Avoid Big SHIPS?Never mind."
2,Kaplan will help you pass NCLEX,"I highly recommend Kaplan products to study for NCLEX. This book goes over various strategies which I found very helpful, and contains 2 practice exams. The grammar and syntax of Kaplan practice questions is similar to the questions presented on NCLEX, so you are calm and comfortable when reading the actual NCLEX questions!If you have any doubts about passing NCLEX on the first try, I strongly suggest you purchase a Kaplan review course. I used the online review course and utilized the question bank, practice exams, and the question trainers to prepare for NCLEX. Their review course costs about $400 but gives you access to over 3,000 questions.I got C's on my last two med-surg rotations but passed NCLEX with 75 questions. I credit my passing score to Kaplan products (and to St. Jude)."
2,African Hunt,A story of a glorious 7 month safari in east Africa 1927. Something that will be very difficult to attempt or emulate today. Carl Trichardt one of the professional hunters of this book was a veteran of 5 wars and was decorated with the Military Cross For Bravery in World War I. Very well written and easy to read. The book also gives a little insight into some of the East African tribes and interesting information on some of the wild animals. For the hunter and adventure reader alike I recommend this book.
2,You better get this cd,"Well I have heard many trance compelations cds over time and I have heard the Ibiza Euphoria 2 cd set mixed by Matt Darey. Hell pretty much the entire Euphoria collection is good but this cd, well I must say this CD is certainly it. If you hate the trendy beats, and the same popular songs, this cd does not follow that. The beats range from fast to slow, the breakdowns are well done, and when the cd makes it to its climax it will just make you want to jump up, even if you are listening to it in your car. Certainly a CD to be played when you want to be put in a better mood, or just simply sit out and relax. This cd is it. Get it!"
2,Good Music,"I purchased this for a friend who really likes Hammer (I thinkhe's pretty good, too). He enjoys it. It came quickly with noproblems. Thank you to the seller (and Amazon.com)."
1,Sounds like Brel died in London!,I have the original cast recording from '66 on vinyl...even with all the scratches it's easier to listen to than this. The off-Bway show ran forever...this one would have been lucky to make it a week.
2,Favorites From College,"This album brings back so many fun memories from college. At one time I had the CD; however, I have moved a few times since college and lost it along the way. I finally gave up looking for it and downloaded. I recommend to anyone who likes the barenaked ladies.."
1,Not fascinating,The book tells the story about a 35-year old man called Rob. He has his own record shop and many problems with girls and women. His girlfriend Laura left him and now he wants to sort out his old relationships. He calls five girls he once loved to know why they split up. Every woman reacts in a different way.His friends are Barry and Dick who help him in his record shop although there is not much work. Barry is a mess and Dick is very shy.Most of the time the book is easy to read and sometimes even easy to understand. The language reflects Rob's chaotic way of life. There are many trains of thoughts in brackets in some chapters. I would give 2 stars to the book because the book is not fascinating and in many chapters boring because there is no real plot.
2,Good suspense,"I got this to replace an old vhs copy, love it! Sometimes the oldies really are the ones to watch!"
2,informative material,This book provides a nice review of Office 2003 and is very helpful learning to use the different areas of it.
2,Super Comfort Wedge,"I sell my knitted products at markets that vary from 3 to 6 hours in length. During that time, I usually sit and knit while I wait for customers. This used to be a major problem, as prolonged sitting would aggravate the arthritis in my sacroiliac joints, and getting up would be difficult on the knees. This wedge does not collapse when I sit on it. It maintains me at just enough height that I can get up and down without knee strain. My back is much more comfortable when I sit for extended times, too. This was such an economical fix for some very painful problems!"
1,Make your baby cry,"The name given this technique by fans is Ferberizing, and it means to put your baby in her crib and let her cry herself to sleep. You go in on a schedule to reassure her and then leave her again and again until she succombs to sleep. I just could not do this to my precious baby and destroy the bond we have between us. I tried it once and she was sobbing and holding up her arms saying Mama and looking as innocent and confused and hurt as I've ever seen her. It broke my heart. Never again. I'm taking a different path and using The No-Cry Sleep Solution for gentle ways to help her sleep better. And now we both feel better."
2,Best nonprescription acne remover on the market.,"This is by far the best and strongest non-prescription acne medication on the market. Yes, it dries your skin - you can't jump feet first into twice a day usage and must follow up with a moisturizer. I also avoid the sensitive areas around my lips, eyes, and ears or they itch/peel. With less than one month of usage, old acne scars have faded and new breakouts are almost obsolete. With a little patience, this is an excellent product."
2,Palmer pizzelle iron,"I've used my new pizzelle iron twice and have to say it's doing the job. A little oil spread on the iron at the beginning (as per the instructions)keeps the wafers from sticking so I don't feel a Teflon coat is necessary. It takes only a couple of pours to figure out how much time is needed for the perfect wafer. The only negative is that the recipes included with the instructions are for dozens of wafers, but recipes for smaller quantities are easy to find online. This is my newest kitchen toy and I'm happy to have it."
1,When I was a kid.....,I saw this at the local theater when i was a kid. When I purchased this I was thinking it was a different movie but soon into it I remembered it from my childhood. The picture quality isn't very good and watching it one more time for me was enough just to see Mamie Van Dooren. I would say if your into the old black and white movies it's worth a look but don't spend more than a rental fee on it.
1,I hate it,I originally downloaded this item thinking it was the movie. It wasn't and I was disappointed. Why waste the time to put a 7 minute clip or interview out there?
2,Down and Dirty,"For the agent that is looking to supercharge their agency, The tapes are a must. The tapes also provide good information for the agent that is just setting up shop. Some of the information given is not found in the book."
2,Amazing!!!!!,"I ordered this and two others seasons from cdexchange and I not only got them extremely quick, but they were in mint condition!!!! I have order cd, dvds, and many other items online from both amazon.com and ebay and this was by far my best experience yet!!!!! Anyone looking for cds or dvds but are afraid to get a bad deal should use these guys because they are just amazing!!!"
2,Neat book,I bought this book for my granddaughter after reading the reviews on it. This is such a cute book and one that I'm sure every little one will enjoy reading and you will enjoy sharing it with them. Recommended.
2,Very useful,"I found this book to be very useful to me. The author presents a positive, upbeat prespective of the oppurtunities and challenges presented by the Internet."
1,Poor Functionality,"I work in the emergency communications field where reliability is a must! We just had our old USB switch (which worked flawlessly, wish I could remember who made it) repaced with this one. I do NOT recommend this one for the following reasons:a) Slow switching. We use 3 of the 4 ports and switching is very slow (3-4 second lag time). Unacceptable in my line of work.b) Single directional switching. If there's a 'reverse' function, I am unaware of it. And if I'm unaware of it then it can't be very user friendly.c) It ""crashes"" a lot. Probably a couple times a week in 24/7 operation. When it crashes you have to unplug all your devices so that it can power-down.Again, I do not recommend this product for anything more than ""casual"" use."
1,"""Metal Phantom of the Exorcist""","I think that ""progressive-rock"" needs one more distinction added as far as classification. If the musicians, no matter how articulate, love rage, anger, and violence; anf feel that every event they encounter is the fault of ""society...or GOD"", and take no personal responsibility for their own sanity- THAT KIND of 'music' should should come with a warning: This CD is not intended to bring greater clarity or insight. It is merely designed to help you play out your rage. Another Gothic nightmare....ho-humm . I think I'll have a beer with Tony Iomme."
2,Honest and Straighforward,"When I became more interested in Judaism (as a secular Jew with almost zero connection to/knowledge of Judaism), I bought this book. Although it is written for converts, it has a knack for succinctly explaining 'what Judaism is', as opposed to fundamental Jewish beliefs, etc., and I would reccomend it to anyone exploring issues of Jewish identity. Particularly useful was a section detailing the experiences of various converts, which were all very different and sometimes provocative.I eventually did Geirus under the London Beis Din (as there were issues with my lineage). This was one of my treasured books, and from time to time I reread it to remind myself of the point of it all."
1,grainy but solid (supposedly the best you can get for your hp),"so, this is the best alternative for my hp photosmartD5160 printer (or so hp says). it allows my hp printer to print solid colors only on their cds. for whatever reason, maybe proprietary disc sales, my hp printer may print many lighter color lines through large blocks of solid color if it uses any other inkjet cd. the hp disc itself has a grainy nature to its printed out cds.hp has poor print quality on their cds. if i could go back, i'd buy a different printer that allows better quality prints on ANY inkjet cd. this is so frustrating. hp is making their consumer buy their product that will only print using their cds which gives crappy results. i used to like hp inkjets."
2,great price for a decent duvet cover,"The quality of the cover is decent and will definitely keep you warm during those cold nights. It is a little hard at first, but a few washes will soften it up.Great bargain!"
1,Buy a more expensive one,"I purchased this - as an adult female, the fit is pretty close, my nose is squished and i can not wear my glasses. In addition the interior is not well finished (dripping looking plastic) and contains no padding. the helmet is uncomfortable and does not sit right on my head."
1,quality is bad,"The movie quality is bad, but the photos that the camera prudes is more bad.There is a problem with the color and saturation.The camcorder is very convenes (DVD) but the camcorder is unreliable. My new camcorder has problems with the focus, after use of two weeks!"
2,Easy to use cordless phone with clear instructions,"The GE 25951EE2 cordless phones where easy to setup. The documentation was clear and the phone worked as advertised. Voice quality was excellent. The one problem, was the handsets did not lock securely into the base or charging stations. This was particularly true of the remote handset where it some times took multiple tries to get the handset to stay seated in the charging station. Any movement caused the handset to loose connection to the charging station. Luckily the light on the charging station indicates whether the handset is properly seated and charging."
2,The best book ever!,I think that this was one of the best books I have ever read! It captured my attention right from the very first word to the last! It is a great book for high schol students to relate to. I definately would recomend this book! :)
2,Classic Peanuts,Most of us grew up watching these year after year. I'm so happy to have physical copies in my collection and enjoyed being able to pull them out at my convenience and watch them with my 9 year old son. Love the features and interviews that give great trivia and insight into Charles Schultz.
1,Worst of the TOC Novels,"This book has very little new material from previous TOC books. It doesn't lead the reader as well as The Goal or It's Not Luck. In short it is a ""Rah-Rah"" book telling the reader how great TOC is without giving much detail and in the context of a novel that doesn't create a great amount of character sympathy. I really don't understand how a man as brilliant as Goldratt could have written this. Get The Goal, It's Not Luck, and the appropriate textbook(s) to implement TOC in your business."
2,Classic ghost story,"This is a good, old-fashioned ghost story: intriguing; dark; moody; mysterious and creepy. It's more Dickens than King - at least early King - meaning it's more suspenseful than horrifying (and it's set in foggy, misty England, in a time period that's not really apparent from the story.)It's also the kind of mystery that unfolded slowly enough to keep me interested while at the same time giving up enough details along the way to let me guess (accurately, as it turned out) what was really going on. I always enjoy that, since I can be a bit slow sometimes when it comes to unravelling plot.All in all, a good tale for a ""dark and stormy night."""
1,Is this a PS2 game?,"Nascar 2001 has the feel of a game that was rushed to market. While all the big names and popular tracks are there, the game exhibits some inexcusable graphical flaws that distract from what could have been a superior game. The car and track models look top notch, that is until there's a lot happening on the screen and the resolution starts dropping. Edges get jaggy and the textures get blurry. In 2-player mode the resolution drops so much at times it seems like you're playing a PSOne game. Die hard NASCAR fans might be able to excuse these flaws for all the features and customizable options the game offers, but the rest of us would be better off going elsewhere for racing action"
1,What happened????,I bought this game used at a Gamestop so luckily I didn't spent much on it. The game sucks so don't waste your money. It amazes me that the makers of the game would produce a product with less graphics and features than the first. Doesn't make sense to me. It makes me unsure if I want to waste my money on Offroad Fury 3..I guess I'll wait until I hear some positive reviews.
2,it worked,Was easy to use and worked very quickly with no difficulties. No Complaints. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and everyone else.
2,Very happy with my purchase,"Just received my watch 2 days ago. Amazon shipping was fast, as usual. Did not have any difficulty with the latch as some have reported. Adjusting the latch to have a more snug fit was easy to do once I actually looked at the diagram in the manual. One commentor mentioned how much bigger the face of the watch is compared with other watches. I would have to agree with that observation. Although it didn't take away from how good the watch looks. Only time will tell if the glass cracks as some mentioned. Overall, very pleased with the look and how light the watch feels when wearing. Have not had to worry about the band catching on wrist hairs or long sleeves."
1,NOT the Movie,"This is a pretty fun version of Pirates, but be forwarned, this is not the movie version. This is a tapped live stage performance. Consequently, the audio and video quality is pretty low. Which, frankly, sort of eliminates the purpose of this show."
2,"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Brown Swirls.","This purchase was a gift that was sent to a new parents of a newborn child. As one who had experience with my own children. Buying a quality product is the best investment a person can do. I believe if the new parents continue to have more children, this high chair will last and could be pass-on to the other children. I know our high chair last through our 3 children. We even passed it on to new parents to continue the use with their new born child."
2,MC Beaton just fab.,MC Beaton is one of my favourite authors and does a wonderful job with all her Regency novels. The Poor Relation books are amount her funniest and I just wish there were more to read.
2,Persuasive book with an unusual approach,"The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America's relations to it."
2,just a note to user dave911...,"I haven't bought this item yet, but I will be getting it tomorrow, and I CAN'T WAIT. This is just a note to dave911, regarding his review. The Korn cover from Evanescence is ""Thoughtless,"" not ""My Last Breath.""""My Last Breath"" was on their album, Fallen. . ."
2,Not the last of the original 3 but a great performance,"This is a great cd, but the Editorial Reviews/Album Details section on the amazon page which credit this as ""The Last Ever Live Performance from the Original Lineup that Includes all Three Wilson Brothers on Stage Together"" is false. I myself saw the Beach Boys do a new years eve concert at the forum in Los Angeles on 12/31/1980 and can attest with assurance that Carl, Brian and Dennis (the 3 Wilson Bros.) were all on stage and all performing for the whole show. In addition there were many other shows in the early 80's (I've seen 15 Beach Boy related concerts in my lifetime) which included all three. There were times with Brian missing and a brief time with Carl missing and Dennis had yet to be ""kicked out"" so there were times when all three were there. Regardless this is a great sounding cd, but one should be aware of that false claim."
2,This is a PIRATED LP!,"Ras Midas released ""Stand Up Wise Up"" on Celluloid (France). It was NOT RELEASED on Spalax. This is a pirated copy of Ras Midas's album. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS. It is copywrite infringement and pirating! -Nan Lewis, Entertainment Works, Manager for Ras Midas"
2,I recommend this film,"This film gets your attention from A to Z . Charlotte Rampling'splay is excellent and sustains perfectly an interesting scenario.Ludivine Sagnier is not masterful but plays well her part.Although this film has it's nude and erotic momentsyou should buy another film if this is only what you are looking for.The film is not a 'nail biter ' but, always intelligent andsensitive, it will not let you down. The conclusion of thefilm is not perfect, but certainly interesting."
1,Shoddy quality,"My review isn't about the story aspect of the book, but rather the physical quality of this edition. It's, well, crap. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. As someone else said, it looks cheap. As if this was some new author who had her book printed independently. And the print is miniscule. I never complain about print, but this book is just dreadful. Tiny print and the lines are extremely close together.I'm supposed to be reading this for my book club, but I strongly suspect I'm going to be looking for another edition to use. I suppose I got what I paid for; the quality of this one is just awful."
2,Cuisinart Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill,"The Cuisinart does a good job, but the static between the plastic container and the grinds is frustrating and can get messy. I would recommend looking at a grinder with a glass container if you can afford it. Otherwise, this is a great product."
1,"Outdated Illustrations, review of Different Product","The program keystrokes shown are good. This book was probably more useful in 2004 when it was written. But the illustrations of Tivo menus are not like those found on todays Tivo. A large section is devoted to programing and using a device made by Pioneer, not the Tivo. Why not rewrite the book and bring it up to date?"
1,not recommended,"I would not recommend this product. It is not like a pampered chef garlic press. The plunger is too small for the vessel, so the garlic is squeezed up the sides instead of down through the intended holes. And, the second time I used it, the two pieces of the press came apart. I can put them back together, but it is not what I expect in quality. Not worth spending the money to send it back. My daughter took my pampered chef press and I want it back!"
1,don't waste your time or money,"We read this book in our book club because we visited the inn near Estes Park that it is loosely based on. The inn is wonderful, the book is terrible. It is very poorly written in every aspect; so much so that it's a wonder anyone published it. Don't waste your time or money on this book."
2,It's Cool,"I adore this laptop cooling pad. It's super quiet, and you don't have to worry about losing a USB slot because the plug for the cooler has another slot built into it.My laptop is running *so* much better now. Love it."
1,disappointed,"This item did not work, even when a second replacement was sent. I was very disappointed because it was MADE by Honeywell. No matter what temp. you set the thermostat to to energize at it had a mind of it's own."
2,Good Information!,"This book provided quality information, however it was hard to read at times. The pyramid information is incorrect (new pyramid was posted online recently) but the information on vitamins is well presented and easy to learn."
2,GREAT!!!!!,"If your gong to get one Mario Lanza CD or CD Set get the Mario Lanza Collection, But if you want to get one more, get this one, Mario Lanza At His Best. This is one CD (not a set like the collection) which contain many beautiful Italian folk songs and then competes with the songs from Lanza's Movie, The vagabond king. Lanza sings wonderful renditions of Funiculi Funicula, Dicitencello Vuie (just beautiful), Maria Mari (my Grandmothers favorite song), Voce e' Notte, Canta pe' Me, O Surdato Namurato, Comme Facette Mammeta?, Santa Lucia Luntana, Fenesta Che Lucive, Ta Ca Nun Chiagne, 'Na Sera 'e Maggio, and Passione (Which is just beautiful. Then the CD moves to the songs form the vagabond King; Drinking Song, Some day, Love Me Tonight, only A Rose, Tomorrow, Nocturne, Song of the vagabonds and Finale all well done. Judy Rasking sings with Mario on Some day, Only A Rose, Tomorrow, and Finale."
1,A re-release under a different name?,"If you are interested in what the music press has to say about MUSE, knock yourself out. This is not a documentary of the band, nor does it contain interviews or insight into their impressive history. If I wanted the opinion of the music press, I would read the NME. A complete waste of time and money."
1,Lacking,"I have been a fan of the true crime genre for many years now, and can say that this is the first time I have felt that the victim actually played a part in their own death. This is the story of an obvious sociopath who happens to become an MD. The victim in this story appears more concerned about her status and bank account than she does about her safety or her husbands mental health. The victim knew her husband's rage and continued to stay with him so that he could finance her education and pay for her new lifestyle. I don't see how anyone who knew them would later be surprised that it ended in such a horrific manner."
1,Very disappointing,"My husband shelled out over $100 for this dreck to give me as a Christmas gift. What a waste of money! I could barely listen to the first three disks, the quality was SO poor. The songs are obscure, recorded in mono, scratchy - horrid. I've never even bothered to play the rest. This very expensive dust catcher is now sitting on a shelf until I can justify throwing it away. My advice? Don't waste your money. Get a CD of the Capitol Years - much, much better."
1,dangerous product,"First of all, as the others reviewers pointed out< the instruccions for assembly are horrible. Second, the net is of very low quality; it pierced in less than 3 month. It was very scary hearing that ball boucing off three diferent houses after a ball pierced a hole thru it."
2,Pretty Awesome Little Machine,"I bought this steamer for the huge task of steaming creases out of a large 10x20' green screen, which is stored folded up until we need it. I had a hand-held steamer which took about 2 hours to steam the entire thing. I decided to sink the $50 into this steamer to save me time, and BOY did it ever! I was done with the entire screen in less than 45 minutes. It chugs out that steam like a pro. Sure, sometimes the steam would build up at the top when you stuck it directly on the fabric from behind, but once you get the hang of keeping it at a 1/2"" distance from the fabric, man does it work great! Definitely on par with a professional $200 model, which I've used in the past at clothing stores."
1,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"ASIDE FROM THE TYPOS, THIS BOOK LEFT ME FEELING EMPTY. DID CALL AND GUS EVER DO ANY GOOD AT ALL 0N THE PLAINS. SEEMS TO ME THEY JUST RAN AROUND IN CIRCLES CHASING INDIANS AND MEXICANS. IN LD U FEEL LIKE THEY ACCOMPLISHED GREAT THINGS IN THEIR YOUTH. THOUGHT THEY WERE TWO OF THE MOST FAMOUS TEXAS RANGERS THAT EVER LIVED COMANCHE MOON DIDN'T SUPPORT THIS."
1,This game was not so great,"well, there were great graphics, the plot was cheesy, the characters were idiots and the game play was horrible. I'm sorry but I couldn't stand this game. the further I got the more I grew to hate it. You do all this reapetitive fighting to get to maybe a few seconds of great graphics. they liked to talk to lot to. I guess that's what role playing games do, but these characters were just so dumb. So if you haven't gotten this game and don't know why you haven't, now you know."
1,FAILS TO DELIVER,"I think the plot of this book is very poor. It reads like a first draft. Not really much of a mystery, and the love line doesn't have enough time to develop because of the mystery angle. Why the author chose to bring in elements of theater and stage into the story is understandable considering the author's background, but this really detracts from the stroy. Very little originality and the acting metaphors are too obvious and unenlightening. Descriptions of Shanghai and modern day China may seem ""gritty"" but they are superficial at best. The author needs to research future works better, and I'll think twice before I try him again."
1,Beware - It Has No Tuner,"I bought this and to my dismay, I come to find that the VCR has no TV tuner in it. This means, it will only record that which it sees on the TV. It has a ""timer"" function but since you can't program a channel with it, because it has no tuner for channels, you're basically programming it to start recording - WHILE at the same time having to set a timer (if you have one) on your TV to turn on at the exact same time, in order for a timer recording to work. You would then have to be watching whatever it was taping while it was taping. It also says the TV must be on in order to record. What good is any VCR if it doesn't have it's own internal tuner? They could and should have made it more clear that this very important feature is missing, which is why I give it 1 star."
2,Adds alot to the motion picture,The animation improves upon the motion picture and links to it in a very good way. the addition of new heroes was a nivce thing to sea in this episode. Also the charecters' interaction is done very well. Legend of crystania stikes another five star...
1,Apalling script for an awesome story,"The trailer is very compelling but alas, also the only success in this Clint Eastwood production! The true incident from 1928 is dramatic and inspiring and should have made an excellent script.The characters are appallingly weak almost as though the period costumes and set were a distraction! Angelina is hugely disappointing as one may expect but John Malkovich? Clearly the director has failed. The screenplay is a whole disappointment unto itself and not just because its predictable in a school play sort of way. If the Academy had to award bad performances, this movie would sweep a dozen. This movie also features the worst portrayal of a police captain in the history of film (again, clearly the director's failure.) The narration of the gruesome slaughter of mere children is so terrible, its actually not disturbing!Worst of all, it runs about 2.5 hours. What a waste!"
2,Simply the best,"Ok guys, I started out never having owned a sleeping mask in my life and I wanted one for sleeping on the hammock ... No mask came close to this thing... It blocks 100% of light, and this is outside mind you.. the foam is so soft, I can't see how people can call this discomfort! The front is a hard plastic.. very tough.There you have it: the best sleeping mask on the market.Also... I sleep on my side with no problems with this on ... So again... I just don't get the dislikes with people saying they can't sleep on their sides with this mask.. You tighten it up a bit and it works fine, the foam is so soft it doesn't bother me at all.."
1,Won't be buying this anytime soon...,"I was planning to buy a Kindle2 this week. However, after Amazon's bone-headed decision to delete e-books that people purchased without their consent, I have decided to pass and purchase a Sony Reader or wait for the CrunchPad. I buy A LOT of books from Amazon, but am now considering switching to Barnes & Nobel....Bad form..."
2,Outstanding!,This book is a great purchase for teachers of struggling readers and includes helpful strategies and techniques as well as lessons. It also has word lists which are a wonderful resource.
2,Tales Have Good Surprise Endings,"I ended up liking this DVD because each story have a surprise ending that makes the story satisfying and suspense along the way was worth it. Victoria Principal looks fabulous, for someone not in her 20s or 30s (though I don't know how old she's here), and I had hoped to see some nudity but there wasn't any. But she did pretty good being leading role in each tale."
2,It does the job for a reasonable price,I wanted a no-frills dust cover for just a few bucks. This one fits be bill quite well.Seems durable enough but it looks like it probably would do better in the shade or in a covered parking as it is not as thick and durable as my previous but more expensive one.
2,Outstanding,"Among the great American novels.This is my opinion. Not all will like it. It's not for people who read only Turow, Ludlow, or the other stuff always stocking the airport marts.Guidelines for my taste, other of my favorites include: ""Catch-22,"" ""Infinite Jest,"" ""Lonesome Dove,"" ""The Dogs of March,"" ""Cryptonomicon,"" and many novels by Cormac McCarthy and Jim Thompson."
1,New version is not the same quality,"I've loved this model for over 10 years but they have drastically changed the product, e.g. the power cord is the only thing that is not made as cheaply as possible. It is not just the one I got either; I bought a second one and it was as low quality as the first. I believe the Presto brand is an adequate replacement if you loved the former version like I did."
1,The worst product ever...,"this is the worst dvd/vcr player i have ever had and seen... after couple of months it is not working even though it is ""sony""Dont buy it you will be very dissapointed...P.S 1 Star because i couldnt vote for less.."
1,Utter Waste of Money,"My wife bought this at Bed, Bath & Beyond because we had gift certificates. We have a Cuisinart coffee maker that has worked reasonably well and we needed a good, heavy-duty blender to replace our old Kitchen Aid.This thing is cheap plastic made to look like metal. In addition, whoever designed it had no consideration whatsoever for those using it. You need a hammer to get the lid on. I am not joking about this. The first time I tried to get it on I literally had my full body weight shoving down on the lid and it still didn't go all the way in. Getting the lid off is not quite as bad, but nearly so. A crowbar might help.The second nasty surprise is when you try to pour the contents into any container. The pour spout is ludicrously small. We could find no way to pour a fruit smoothie out of the container without spilling a good portion out onto the counter.We are going to take it back if we can. Do yourself a favor and avoid the hassle we went through."
2,Great Replacements,I use my cordless tools allot in my work. I have to replace a couple batteries about every two years and found these to be the best price and deal at the time of need.
2,Super easy to use,"The scanguage has been a very satisfying purchase, super easy to install (just stick it in place with velcro and plug it in) and easy to use, with all kinds of information about the functions of the engine. I'm using it to optimize my driving for fuel economy, and it shows me instantaneous fuel use as well as mileage by the trip, by the day, or by the tank. You can also use it for miles-to-empty and for engine diagnostics.Great product."
1,Really bad customer service.,"I've been a loyal customer of Lodge cookware for twenty years. I bought nearly their entire line of cookware, and have promoted their cookware every chance I got. Lodge is family owned. They have really bad customer service. I bought a brand new Wok, that rusted before I ever used it. I asked them if I could return the never used Wok, and asked if they could send me a new one at cost. They refused. Most customer service departments would do more to help a loyal customer."
2,Thanks.,Love the movie. Into horror movies and this one is good. Keep up the good work so I can order more.
1,Slow going,"I had a hard time getting through this, I think because the first few minutes I didn't really know who the characters were or what was going on. It was just kinda confusing. This seems to have the most money of all the films but the story really hurts it. It seems like the people who made it knows what they're doing, so maybe their next movie will be better."
1,Do not be hoaxed by the media hype!!!,"I loved her cover picture on CD. However, her music is not really world class. Well, I do strongly recommend to listen before you buy. Otherwise you will be sorry. I have seen her on T.V when I was in Germany,Munchen. Well, her live performance was also not that impressive. anyhow, time will tell if she is realy talanted or something else."
2,Ace Ventura double feature,"I got this to upgrade my keep-case full-screen stereo dvd, and in some ways, it seems like it would be obviously better, but... I'll explain:This new set features the first film in wide-screen for the first time, and upgrades the stereo sound to 5.1 surround sound. Sounds good, right? BUT... the film is cut, though I only noticed this in one particular instance: the scene where Ace pretends he's the dolphin trainer is missing. Apparently, the director didn't want it, so does that make this the director's cut? I don't know...The film also features a director's commentary and trailers, while the second film only has trailers (and is in wide-screen with 5.1 sound). Also, the films feature ""new digital transfers"", so take that as you will...Then, the set includes a bonus disc of what appears to be a few episodes of a crudely drawn animated series. Three episodes, to be exact, but by the looks of them... I may get around to watching them... in a few years..."
2,Great product for the money,I got these for my child as an alternative to the in-ear buds and I have to admit I am surprised by the quality. The sound is clear and the noise cancelling is of a good quality considering the price. This is a good set of cans for an entry level listener.
2,Only kind my wife will use.,"I've tried to buy cheaper stuff, or catch protein on sale. Ever since GNC stopped carrying Any Whey i've had to search for it because my wife refused to try any other kind. It may be the amount of calories, or the amount of protein, but whatever it is, she absolutely DEMANDS that i get her Any Whey. Must be good. Thanks Amazon."
2,Helped me cope with what happened to the baby,"After two years of infertility and two consecutive pregnancy losses at 8 weeks and 13 weeks, I have read many excellent books that helped me understand and deal with the emotional aspects of my miscarriages. However, none of them dealt as directly as I would have liked with what happens to the baby. I instinctively felt that the baby would be in heaven, but I was clueless as to what kind of form the baby would take, if I would know my baby when I got to heaven, etc.This book addressed these questions very directly and with excellent scriptural back-up. I now have every confidence that I will spend eternity with both of my children, and that we will know and love each other when we are reunited.This book is NOT a guide for dealing with the grief aspects of pregnancy loss, but it will answer many questions about the reality of your child as a living being. The answers to these questions were a big help to me in my quest for healing."
2,Nice tea pot!,"I just received this tea pot. It seems like great quality, but the tea pot came with the black handle unattached and there is no easy way to attach it that we can find. Not sure if it is supposed to come attached and this is an error, or what."
2,Mini fridge lived up to expectation,"The Danby stainless steel fridge was shipped to Hawaii and was in great shape when it arrived. The unit was as expected and we were quite happy. If there was a negative, the little freezer did not keep ice cream real frozen...frozen enough but not real hard. Other than that, the unit was as expected and we would recommend the unit to any and all looking for something like this...especially because of the reasonable price both on the unit itself and the shipping charges."
2,Only one flaw,"This is an excellent recording. However, the Black Swan pas de deux is not in the where most companies place it. It seems buried in the middle, when it is usually the culmination of the third act. However, this is easily correctible in rehearsal and performance, and everything else is stunningly beautiful."
2,Great Flat Iron,I purchased this product for my daughter to replace a Chi that she has owned for years. This is a Great product and it was shipped promptly. I would definately purchase from this seller again.
2,A little disappointing,"I never encountered Lewis's books as a child in the 50s and was glad to be spurred to read this one recently for a children's book discussion group. I was a little disappointed with it, after hearing about it for so many years. The language isn't great, and the boy/girl roles seemed so conventional--dated anyway. One scene in the book is fantastic, however; it's the one of Aslan's crucifixion and resurrection, metaphorically disguised.Take Me With You When You Go"
2,Fun and a good gift,"Perfect for the pre-teen or early teen. Parental supervision is required on some things, but overall it's a fun book and a great gift."
2,Awesome! Could not put it down!,This was a great story! I finished the book hoping for more Mick Haller! Great suspense and will be reading more Michael Connelly books!
2,The best system out there,"Well I searched alot for the best, and I bought the Peg-Perego but it was the worst! I had to exchange it three times. So finally I saw the reviews on the Chicco Cortina, and decided to go with it. Well all the reviews were right on, this is the best system. It is easy to use, and very nice. I dropped some juice on it and it cleaned right up! How NICE.... And EASE! wow, the stroller really can be closed with one hand. The infant seat is very lightweight, and the stroller with the adjustable handle... I just cant say enough, I just wish I had purchased this one first and never had to experience the other one.The Chicco Cortina is hands down the best system out there."
1,All the best songs were left off........ WHY ?,"First of all let me start of by saying Woodstcok was great. The media blew up what happened on Sunday night, when all it was, was us blowing off steam at the hole production of it. Now onto the CD, it is half way decent but there is no and I mean no emotion in it at all..So many songs were left off that DEFINATELY should have been on there. For example Sheryl Crow's version of ""Sweet Chlid of Mine"".....Mickey Harts -Fire on the Mountain, Collective Souls version of an OZZY song, Kid Rocks cover of a John Fougerty tune, and they could have picked a much better song from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, like half way through their set when they just JAMMED. Plus countless more. Whoever put this together should be fired. As a vetran of both Woodstock 94' & 99' I am very dissapointed in this CD, I hope whoever is listening will take my advice and put out the real WOODSTOCK 99' Album, it will do alot better than what you have here. Enough said ! -Mike-"
2,Calphalon Everyday Nonstick 6-Quart Dutch Oven,a few weeks ago I replace my stainless steel dutch oven with a Calphalon Everyday Nonstick 6-Quart Dutch Oven. Food easily burned and stuck to the bottom of the stainless dutch oven. Now I don't have this problem anymore. I am happy with my purchase.
1,Awful Live Versions,I thought this cd was a bargain until I listened to it. These were terrible live performances with awful sound recording.DON'T BUY
1,Scratched,I was so excited about sitting down with my family to watch the movie when 5 minutes into the film it started to skip and when we went to check the disc...it had a scratch down it. We had just taken it out of the wrapping straight to the player. This is the first time this has happened too with an Amazon order.
1,Save your money!,"If you are a user of Quicken for Windows, don't even think of switching to this product. Spend your money on Parallels, and run the Windows version on your Mac. Quicken for the Mac would not be a good deal if they gave it away for nothing. Too many things, including conversion of your data files, just do not work."
1,Not what I expected,"If you look at the picture for this type of Chex Mix you see the OLD version of Bold Party Blend, which is what I ordered and wanted.What I received instead is the new packaging with the new, far less robust, recipe. (look in your local grocery isle for the new packaging).On top of not getting what I expected, a first from Amazon I might add, there are no returns for food items (probably other items as well, but I haven't run into them yet), most likely for excellent reasons in today's world.I am, however, disappointed. If Amazon had changed the picture I would have known it was the new mix, and wouldn't have ordered it.General Foods, who's product this is, was of no help either."
2,"Funny, moving story of return to faith","Carol Orsborn movingly describes her return to the faith of her childhood, Judaism. No sentimental hash here; this spiritual renewal came through study and hard work while Orsborn was a student at the Vanderbilt University Divinity School. She paints a very realistic picture of the current state of education in university-related divinity schools, and the composite characters she uses are sometimes howlingly funny (and familiar). This is not just a book for Jews; anyone hoping to make peace with the faith of his or her early years will find in this book a helpful, hopeful story. I have loaned it to several members of my church who are struggling with Christianity. What is important for me and the readers I know is not so much the faith to which Orsborn returns, but the journey she makes. That journey can be universal."
2,i love this cd,"i couldnt wait for this cd to come out, and now that it has its like my prayers have been answered! the tracks with jordan from nfg are great. mxpx have the best songs and they are awesome in concert i've seen them 7 times"
1,"God is great, this movie isnt.","This movie is advertized as a comedy, but there's nothing funny about it. It's long, and a pure melodrama. I was totally disappointed"
1,Way too slippery!,"I found this floss very frustrating to use. It kept slipping out of my fingers and it was impossible to get a good grip on it. We normally use Crest Glide but for some reason my husband just bought Oral-b Satin instead. It is much harder to use than Glide and I did not feel like it cleaned as well either, even though it took twice as long! I'll stick with Crest Glide."
2,"Even her ""not the best"" is good","Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty are quickly explored, so there is less to learn -- or even write about -- in this espisode in Anna Pigeon's career. The upside is that we learn more about the characters of Anna and her sister, Molly, and so do they. Not being as fast-moving as the rest of this series does not condemn it. Nevada Barr is a fine writer and this is a good read. What's with the fixation on movies, though?"
2,great watch,"I am very happy with it. It is stylish,durable,shines brighty so you can see it at night. A great bargain."
2,Love the music from this series,"After finding and watching this series, I fell in love with the music. It is exactly from the series. The songs flow with the ups and downs of life. Love, heartache, loss, hardship and survival. I enjoyed it and I am definitely happy with the purchase. I might even look into purchasing some of the other music."
1,Not the real thing!,"I agree with some of the other reviewers here that said they did not recieve the 'real' Alli from Amazon. I've been using it for several years (purchased elsewhere). What I bought from Amazon looks just like the real thing but doesn't *work* like the real thing: if you've used Alli before, you'll know what I mean. I would purchase elsewhere, the price is this low for a reason."
1,Poor Quality,"The quality was not good. I put Disk 3 in the DVD player and when it appeared on my TV screen, it was reading disk 1. There was something wrong with the disks. I believe it was not the original DVD. i would say that it was a copy.The picture on the third disk was not clear and defined. The picture had a blue tint to it. Poor quality. I sent the set back and ordered the original set through PBS - Masterpiece Theater. I will never order anything from Amazon again, except dog training books.I believe there are counterfeiters who list their products with Amazon."
2,Neat,Its pretty cool but slow. I can open a bottle by hand faster but its fun to bring out when I have company.
1,2 MONSTER ISLAND in pan & scan scam,"Being like a Harryhausen film I expected at least 5 monsters. There were 2 stop motion types (tho 2 of one and a few of the other), and a dumb creature from the monster lagoon (ohh not again).Ohh, plus one dummy spider for 1.5 seconds that doesn't move.The stop motion is as good as any.You can see from the clips in the behind the scenes it is cropped from the original widescreen! What a mistake for an effects intravoganza (or any DVD unless having 2 versions).I am over the age of 13."
1,Second Jaws sequel is dull but has some redeeming qualities.,"The 2nd Jaws sequel is definetely not the worst, Jaws The Repulsive, I mean Jaws The Retarded, oops I MEAN JAWS THE REVENGE IS!!!!!!!! Jaws 3 has a great musical score, nifty plot, and a few dramatic moments, BUT... none of the characters are really engaging. You don't care about them as people so the movie is dull. Atleast the film is original. The plot centers around Brody's son Michael(Quaid) and his job at seaworld in Florida. Roy Sheider is sorely missed."
1,god help us,"Oakenfold may be the worlds number 1 DJ because of the amount of money he makes but that doesnt make him any good.His cds are bad and his live sets are even worse. Ive seen him like and he disappoints. Not only is his mixing sub standard live, he can hardly beatmatch.I would recommend Danny Tenaglia for those who truly appreciate good music."
1,Meh.,"I ordered this for my boyfriend last year for Christmas, and was a bit disappointed with the result. The screwdriver is NOT realistic; it's plastic and very dull. The sound worked and was pretty fun, until it broke after about a month from use. Basically if you are expecting an exact sonic screwdriver replica, then don't go for this. It's really fun to play with though! Probably best for a child."
2,"Yes, it is that good!","We had to think twice before purchasing a toaster oven at this price. It is a great decision because we use it so often. For a fancy appliance with many features, the controls are intuitive and easy use. There is a signal to let you know when the oven has come up to temperature and another bell for the timer. These are handy features that help you get consistent results and not burn food. Once we got use to the larger size of this oven, we saw the benefit of using it for things like a batch of cookies, a small pizza and hot rolls.The build quality is excellent. It is easy to clean. The handle is well insulated so you do not burn your fingers trying to open the door. The food tray is easy to slide out. You will enjoy using this toaster oven."
1,Waste of time.,A very thin plot is used to express Crichton's ultra-conservative views on the environment. Too slow and too preachy. George Bush would love this one.
2,EXACTLY What I needed!,"Yes, it's a small shelf, but it's the PERFECT size to put between your desk and the wall if you want to get your CPU off the desk or floor. The CPU is on the top shelf, modems and routers on the second shelf and surge protectors on the bottom shelf - all in one place, out of the way and easy to move when you want to clean. Also, the shelf is easy to put together and VERY sturdy. I plan to get some in larger sizes to use in the mudroom."
2,They love it!,"Both my younger cat (<1 year old) and my large dog love this toy. They will sit on opposite sides of it and push the ball to each other. My two older cats (16 years old and 3 years old) pretty much ignore the ball and just enjoy the cardboard scratcher part.The cardboard insert can be flipped over and the other side used before needing to completely replace it.I like the fact that replacement cardboard scratchers and replacement balls can be easily obtained through both local shops and online.I purchased this after seeing my mom's cat (7 years old) playing with it. Apparently it appeals to cats of every age, but I would think kittens would find it most entertaining."
2,Good Info,"This book offered a lot of helpful information about detoxification through fasting. It gave me step by step, what to do to cleanse my body through fasting. However, I had read more than half of the book before I actually got any usable information. For such a small book, I thought it would be packed with info and how-to's on detoxification, but it constantly tells you to buy her other book ""How to Feel Great All The Time"". If you do lots of research on holistic health as I do, there is a lot of general information about eating healthy and such in this book, which I already know a lot about. If you know nothing about holistic health, this book will be an eye-opener."
1,Suckiest Album of All Time,Everything on this albums sucks. If I could have I would have rated it 0/5. This isn't even music. If you want real music listen to some Sabbath or ACDC.
2,"Best album of ""the poets""","The canadian poets have offered to us their best album ""up to here"" with their all time classic ""New Orleans is sinking"", great rock n roll with heavy blues and southern rythms, amazing style a very defined personality , Mr Gordon Downie is a genious also a man with a great inspiration and artistic sensibility, we need more songwritters like him, The Tragically Hip is also a very united band, members have remain the same for over 20 years they havent fall into the trap of fame and their style doesnt change for commercial success , they feel happy with their legion of die hard fans like me that will always love the hip as our little selfish secretHM"
1,Bones,Gruesome and grizzly. I threw it in the trash where it belongs after 100 pages. I didn't want to share it with anyone.
2,Very Interesting Flavor,"Gran introduced me to another world of creative darkness. Spellbound from the first page, I was hooked on dope. Her images of the NYC underworld amazed me. When I finished dope, I thought my heart had stopped beating. What a great read!"
2,"This is Twiggy, and Ken Russell",Delicious musical love story with some of the main characters in show business of their days Impressive coreographical and visual findings
2,Good Historic Resource,"This is a reprint of a 1920's bungalow catalogue. This slim (120 page) volume contains plans for some seventy houses. Most examples contain an exterior phot or perspective rendering and a floor plan. Some examples contain interior views. There is also a section on interior components such as dors, hardware, buitl-ins. This part would be a good resource for the person interested in an authentic restoration of a bungalow. I found the floor plans to be the most valuable part of this book, since most current books on bungalows do not contain plans. It is not a great single-source book, howver for the low price it is an excellent complimentrary resource."
1,Underpowered transmitter,"I wouldn't give this awful fm transmtter to anyone. When the cars radio does recieve the tranmission the quality is terrible, but most of the time it picks up noise and a little of the transmited signal no matter which frequency is selected. Very poor gaget."
2,Great watch,"This is a great watch for beginners at time telling. My daughter loves the butterfly second hand and the reversible band. My only complaint is that we have to keep it a little loose so she can slide it on and off her wrist, otherwise we have to under the whole watch each time. It would be nice if there was a real clasp that could open and close easily."
1,maneaters,"wrong title and if it had been the right title, i would have returned it anyway, because of such poor quality. thank you"
2,"Cheated. I Got The Region 3 DVD. Only 1 Disc. ""Jumping Jellyfish.""","Walt Disney's classic under-the-sea coming-of-age film ""The Little Mermaid"" (loosely based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen) gets the 2-Disc Special Platinum Edition DVD treatment.When I ordered this movie, I specifically ordered the 2-Disc edition, but I recieved the wrong one. I got stuck with the Region 3 DVD, which has only 1 disc and only several special features. As Sebastian would say,""Jumping jellyfish."" I was very disappointed.On to the movie itself, however. The film is a classic, with songs by the Academy-Award winning team Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (who would go on to score ""Beauty And The Beast,"" my all-time favourite movie) and wonderful characters (Ariel, Flounder, Sebastian and Scuttle, among others), the movie is a timeless classic your little girl will treasure forever. Rated G."
1,OH HELL NO!!,"I can't believe I even wasted my time reading this. Im so happy I didn't buy this. Take my advice: Borrow or just don't read. You can come up with a better story in your head. WIFEY would have been so much better if there had actually been some description. It was basically like, I did this, he did that, I went to the shop, I ate, I took a bath and so on. All she did was eat,work, and run her mouth through out the whole book. It was plenty of places to jump in and make it interesting. She just didn't take them. NO IMAGINATION. The plot was there but she just couldn't elaborate.In all seriousness I wish I could give this book no stars. But I guess you get one for the title and knowing your name. AND TO THINK SHE COMES FROM MY STATE.WORK ON THAT SWEETY."
2,Cute!,"This is a good chick flick. Yes, it is predictable but I still liked it. I bought it as a gift for my 16 year old daughters friend."
1,Do not buy- looks aren't everything,"First of all, this computer dies after three months. That's just how first generation Mac products are. Don't buy first generation- it WILL die. This thing freezes literally every time I use it.Secondly, Apple doesn't help at all. Tech support doesn't do anything for you. They refuse to honor my one year hardware warranty, and I've talked to customer service AND tech support, and all they do is try to sell you Apple care- why would I want to extend coverage for a product that they already refuse to honor service for? Their service team isn't a service team at all. They are a group of trained salespeople who try to sell you their product. Why should I have to buy Apple care for something that should already be covered?I've grown up on Macs, and loved them all my life. But the company's integrity is going down hill, and this was the last straw. Between the horrible products and the sleazy ""support,"" I'm never buying an Apple product again. Linux, here I come..."
2,thank you for speedy reaction,I am in Japan.I am sutisfied with this product and parchase.thank you !
1,It falls apart if you put the diapers in it!,"I am so disappointed in this product. It is held together with sticky-back Velcro. There's no need for the Velcro, either, so it must be some cost or time saving thing for Graco. I put the diapers in it, and a few days later, it fell down (the diaper part detached.) My husband fixed it, but the next day it fell down again. I would definitely NOT recommend this part of the Pack n Play!"
2,I love this,My Mama bought this for me about five years ago for Christmas. It reminded me alot of the dishes she cooked for me as a child. There are a lot of great recipes in here and that I know that Elvis enjoyed.
1,disposable mp3's,Our family has had 4 Ipods in the last 2 years only one of them still works. they are not reliable.
1,Worst album ever!,"An Australian friend of mine introduced me to Kylie Minogue and Silverchair because he said they are THE best Aussie artists. Anyway, I got this album and Silverchair's ""Neon Ballroom"". After listening to these two albums, I found that I liked Silverchair because they kinda sound a bit like the Foo Fighters or Bush. But this album by Kylie is THE worst! All the songs are so forgettable and unlike Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, she doesn't even have a good voice. Her voice is so thin and wispy and I really don't know how she got famous. Natalie Imbruglia is, like, 1000 times more talented than Kylie. And, I heard they came out from the same TV show or something. DON'T let your Australian friends fool you into buying this album! Or anything by Kylie Minogue! I learnt my lesson. She is THE WORST!"
1,WARNING: You only get one suet cake - not 12!,"When I ordered this, I thought I was getting 12 suet cakes (because the description said so). But you only get ONE. And $7 and change is a bit steep for one suet cake that costs .69 elsewhere. BUYER BEWARE"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,And i'm not going to waste my time delineating the innumerable inadequacies of this tediously boring book that offers no new insights into the industry and beast that the author slavishly served for so many years. Blyth is trying to spin herself into another career and she only comes off as an Anne Coulter wannabe in need of a good editor and a better subject.
1,Iffy book,"Book has a good layout, I'll give it that, but after being in Jeet Kune Do for the past 9 years this book didn't show me anything new at all. Even if not a totally new technique I was at least expecting doing something old in a new way, which I didn't find in this book. I don't really know if this book is even that good for beginners, as this thing is so basic I don't know that everything is explained as well as it should be. If you are in a ""reality"" martial art or study under a decent instructor that shows and knows combat applications, don't get this book, I really wished I hadn't bought it now. Mr. Lima is good at what he does I'm sure, but I think the martial arts world would have been fine without this book."
1,Disappointing at best,"My initial experience with this marvelous opera was the original vinyl recording. It was excellent throughout. This rendition, which I bought mostly due to pricing, was very disappointing to me. There was a sense of forced performance, an apparent attempt to ""out-do"" the original cast, and too much energy used to become ""creative"" with the original performance and vinyl recording. I agree with one reviewer who lauds the work of Claire Moore (Mary Magdalene), a key figure in the life of Christ, for purity of sound and depth of vocal quality. However, I stop short of saying she is better than the original cast person.In fact, I'm returning this recording without regard for reimbursement in favor of spending a few bucks more for the original CD recording of JCS.Respectfully,Russell F. Mertz"
1,Not her best,"For a while, during every song, I mostly enjoyed the music. But like a majority of dance music, I get bored with the repetitive lyrics and the looping. It's a good cd to shuffle in your player and clean your house."
1,not good,http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&asin;=0743298039&store;=#In conclusion of what I had read in pages 13-56. I thought the book very hard to follow along with and author was all over the place. I felt the book not to be very interesting. I had hard time to continue to keep reading. I felt this was one of worst books I have read. I found the character Margaret to be as strange as author. I would not recommend this book to anyone to read. I give this book maybe a 2. I had very hard time writing this paper since I found this book really bad.
2,"smooth action, could be sharper","These scissors have a lovely positive action and extremely comfortably grips. The edges seem a bit rough and they were not great for collage on paper-Matisse would probably disapprove. A bit of hand-sharpening improved things, but it doesn't seem like you should have to sharpen brand new scissors."
2,great movie but.....,"This is a great western by one of the great all time actors, Randolph Scott.....HOWEVERI thought I was buying the dvd not a rental to be watched on my computer. Very resently it seems a lot of on-line movie buying has introduced the rental option requiring one to be a little more alert. Can't anything be simple anymore.As I said, it's a great movie. Too good to watched in poor picture quality on a computer.Thumbs down to Amazon on putting the buying and rental on the same page!!!"
1,Not worth the money....,"These earrings were quite pricey for being ""simulated"" pearls. They were also a darker shade of champagne than what I expected them to be. I purchased these to wear to a wedding and now that I've seen them, I'm not sure that I'll even wear them. I was looking for something that appears ""classy"" but these appear somewhat ""gawdy"". I'm not impressed at all."
2,Amazing collection!,"This cd is really good! Every single song is great! My favorites are Spiderwebs, Hella Good, New and It's My Life!"
2,Awesome Bike,Awesome Bike! It is super quiet which is nice. The bike really gives you a good workout and is easy to use. I put the bike together myself and it was simple. The directios were easy to read. I wanted to add a diferent component to running and this was an excellent choice. Very happy with my buy!
2,THE BEST OF THE SMACKDOWN GAMES,"IN THIS ONE, THERE IS NO HOGAN, BUT AT LEAST THE OLD UNDERTAKER IS AVAILABLE AS PART OF THE HIDDEN LEGENDS THAT THE WWE PUT INTO THIS GAME. THIS IS THE BEST OF THE SMACKDOWN GAMES SO FAR. AND IN THIS GAME, YOU CAN PLAY THROUGH THE BEST SEASON MODE EVER PUT INTO A SMACKDOWN GAME. BUT, ONLY 1 MAJOR PROBLEM, YOU ONLY GET TO PLAY 1 YEAR AND THEN THE SEASON'S OVER. BUT IT'S WORTH IT TO ACCESS LEGENDS LIKE JIMMY SNUKA, SGT. SLAUGHTER, THE IRON SHIEK, NIKOLAI VOLKOFF, AND MORE. GET THIS GAME NOW!!!!"

1,Not a very good product,My husband and I bought this product when I first got pregnant and waited till about week 20 to use it. NOTHING...We again tried to use the microphone every few weeks but heard nothing but static. The microphone picked up every sound so we were unable to hear our baby's heartbeat. My suggestion is to wait and see your professional doctor then to buy this product....
1,"A truly strange book, often moving but in the end a letdown","I opened this book ""blind"" - without any reviews or even a dust jacket blurb - and so was totally surprised by the turn the story takes when the ""film festival"" begins, and the presumed main plot turns out to be only a shell.I think it would have been a much better read if the ""past"" and ""present"" storylines had been interwoven with one another rather than the story A prelude-story B-story A postlude as written.And sorry to say, I found the ending totally unsatisfying."
2,"Great Product, Great Customer Service - Needs Design Improvement","Bought this product back in December '09 for our two 6 month old kittens. They took to it immediately and initially it worked without a hitch. After a few weeks it started having trouble finding the home position, sometimes dumping litter on the floor and often stopping upside down leaving no place for the kittens to ""go"".So, we called customer service and they quickly diagnosed the problem - the circuit board must have gotten wet. They shipped a replacement board immediately, it was easy to replace and now it's working like a charm again! It was great that they were able to resolve the issue so quickly however; it was also an indication of a known design flaw. The circuit board should be protected from the elements and certainly not placed where kitties can easily urinate on it accidentally.As others have said, the design could certainly be improved but, it's definitely worth the $$$ in the end!!"
2,interestingly wierd,"Very wierd and interesting movie, have never seen blade runner though (which is what this movie is compared to), a little hard to follow at first but a good sci-fi thriller!!"
1,The Doctor and the unicorns?,"The TARDIS' ongoing problems worsen, and an emergency landing brings the Doctor and Ace to a small Welsh village. Strange creature from legend have been spotted, and a stone circle contains the gateway to another world...The concluding book in the Cat's Cradle trilogy, this one is plainly the work of a first-time author. While every author must write a first book, that is not necessarily ever published. Mr. Hunt shows that he needed more experience to make this book work. I could give a list of faults, but basically they all come down to that he doesn't understand how a book works. This is not to say that he has no potential!Add to this that it is of a type that I don't like (explaining myths and legends as science fiction) means that it certainly wasn't a good read for me."
1,poor shipping policy from vendor,"paid for expedited shipping. item didnt ship for 6 days. vendor didnt respond to first email, was nasty in response to second email. will never deal with this vendor again. love the product."
1,"Pompous, dreadful",Really awful amateur work. I loathe the BJP but this work has about it a certain crude sensationalism and a teenage attempt at 'style' evident in the author's desription of the book - all staccato sentences and a pompous conviction of profundity that is just plain annoying. Might have exotic appeal to a foreigner but is too superficial a treatment of the issue.And by the way - the trick of getting your friends to write reviews is kinda see-through.
1,The mosquitoes are getting smarter!!!!,"Mosquitoes are focusing on human body and have the tendency to stay away from the trap... on the other hand we are catching all kind of insects. I feel that I am taking the dinner away from the bats and other predators.The company should create new look, new scent or new color to outsmart these most disturbing insects."
2,Outstanding,I really enjoyed reading this book from the first page to the last page. It gives you a great idea of what the business could be in the future.
1,Self-loathing,"Hello, My Name Is Thomas Frank. I wrote a book. I'm from Kansas, but I am very ashamed of my background. I feel very insecure when I am around my sophisticated Eastern Establishment idols. So I wrote this book to try to impress my new friends and to disassociate myself from the poor unfortunate souls back home. Goodness knows, I don't want the good people at the New York Times to think that just because I am from Kansas, I am some kind of rural, hick, uneducated religious freak. I mean, if the world must know that I am indeed from Kansas, then perhaps I can somehow redeem myself by bashing my home and the people who live there. That's it - if I can throw in enough stereotypes, skewed statistics, ""colorful characters,"" and mock sympathy, then Maureen Dowd and Howell Raines can see just how much I have overcome from my deprived past. Why, I'll even seem heroic in their eyes! Well, sorry to run, but it's time for me to meet with my French tutor. Au revoir!"
1,"Dishonest, Criminal, Empty","I bought the book at full retail. What an embarrassment. Sucker, one born every minute. Should've read the reviews first on Amazon (the negative ones act like a Better Business Bureau). Kevin is good at motivating/hype, but all the promises are completely empty. Seems he doesn't want you and I to know what these natural cures are any more so than the FDA, etc. You can you pay for access to his website, only to possibly show that you are twice the sucker that you were when you bought his book."
1,It's ok,"The tray is good, but I am trying to find a liner at home depot and the size of this tray doesn't have anything to fit it. So I just painted from the tray and throw it out after i'm done. The roller sucks so much. After using it for 3 mins, I just throw the whole thing out. Next time I will just go for better quality stuff."

2,Good solution to replace ugly ceiling tile,These were purchased to replace the white drop ceiling tiles that were 2'x3' in our half bath. I used 2 in each grid and I had to cut some to get them to fit correctly and they still look good. With the addition of copper tape to the grid it looks beautiful. Easy to install and cut.
1,Poor sound from TV.,Tried to use this for listening to the TV. The sound quality was poor. Did'nt try to use it from the stereo system.
1,The Cove,"The Cove was the first book I had read of Catherine Coulter.And it will be long time before I read another one of hers. It was infantile, badly written, the characters had no depth, and there was all this stilted dialogue in between which was nothing.I am an aspiring author. I have always hated to say this but here goes I COULD WRITE LIKE THIS TOO. PUBLISH ME... Perhaps some day I will try to read another one of Coulter's books, however, it was a waste of my hard earned money to buy it."
1,A big disappointment,"I was really let down by this book because it doesn't address the financing crisis in this country, and how we can pay for care."
2,"Standard YA, a few cool ideas","This is a pretty standard trilogy of a Young adult novel - young girl in a not-so-near post-apocalyptic future, thrust into the middle of a struggle between ""good"" and ""evil"", in love with boy A in first novel, in love with boy B in second, and choosing between the two in the third. That said, I still couldn't put any of the books down until I was done with them. A nice variation on our possible future and a pretty original ""end of the world"" scenario. I enjoyed all three books and recommend them if you liked the Hunger Games."
1,totally caput after 1 year,"thought this was going to be a decent unit, but like several others, cooler died after just over 1 year. would definetely not purchase again. gotta be a piece of junk to only last a year. by the way, ordered product from Compact Appliance like another reviewer...won't be buying anything from them again. good luck to anyone who has this unit."
1,in the name of all that is good and holy...,please take this cd off the market; every last copy should be burned.
1,Sad face,It didn't work in either of my 3 DVD's . However I will continue to use Moviemars. I love their service. I'm definate this is an isolated incident.
1,Too pricey,This is way to expensive. The Wall Street Journal has no distribution expense with this edition and it is not as comprehensive as the print edition. No thanks.
2,A lively account,"I purchased this book in the hope of finding a slant on the second Siege of Malta different from the many other accounts of this famous action. In this regard I was disappointed for although the author spent some time there, his literary contribution adds little to that already published.Lee Heide's commendable involvements with other aspects of The War make more interesting reading but are a little superficial in their recounting and would benefit from more flesh on the bones. There are irritating instances of inattentive editing; anachronisms such as Land Rovers and cassette tapes in West Africa in 1942(!) and there is some padding taken from what obviously have been tourist guides but it is an interesting perspective on aspects of wartime arial operations outside the Northern European theatre and a salutory reminder of the debt Britain has to the Dominions and the sacrifices made in her defence by The Commonwealth."
2,"Not his best, BUT","I enjoyed the short stories here, especially Dabchick, Nausea, and A Perfect Day For Kangaroos. It's not Murakami's best (I prefer The Elephant Vanishes) but I breezed through all the tales with great pleasure. He is the master of Psychological fantasy."
2,An exceptional novel,"It's hard to believe that this is MacDonald's first novel (being a novelist myself). Beautifully written and plotted. What is most intriguing is what she leaves out, in order to circle that material back in, again and again - almost in the way that Faulkner used to circle round a story. She is able to show how the death of an individual continues to haunt and play itself out in the lives of the siblings. A most powerful book. Wonderful characters that I won't forget for a long time. Bravo, Ms. MacDonald for a job well done!"
1,Try Elmers,"Hands down the worst glue I've ever used. Couldn't glue felt to cardboard. Don't buy anything with the words ""gel"" in it. Doesn't work at all. Go for the liquid."
1,STAY AWAY,"What kind of crap is this. EA's developers are too F*ck!ng stupid to create an installer that can utilize any drive. Instead it only looks to your C drive and will not allow you to install the game/patches if there is not atleast 3Gigs there. I have over 400Gig free space on my system spread across multiple partitions but its not in the system partition so I can't install this game I just puchased. EA, Digital Illusions.... YOU SUCK, why don't you go to the local high schools and find some real programmers.If you are even contemplating this game make sure you have the required disk space on your C drive for install, this is above and beyond the actual install of the game and not necessarily where you installed Battlefield 2 or where you will install the expansion.I'm sure the game itself is fun if you EVER get to play it, as for myself I will be returning the game to my local EB store tomorrow and writting an equally if not harsher Email to EB support."
1,Very Disappointing,"The glowing reviews of this book compelled me to buy it. I regret this decision.I could not identify with any of the characters. Dalva is a character invented by a man who obviously doesn't have a clue as to how a woman thinks. I could not relate to or sympathize with her at all.Michael is a self-absorbed alcoholic who has a failing academic career and has the sexual maturity of a 13-yr. old boy.Naomi and her father-in-law were the only characters that engaged me and they were hardly developed in a satisfying way.The history of the Sioux people seemed to be thrown in as almost an afterthought, though this was the most compelling aspect of the book.Overall, this book was a disappointment even though the storyline could have made for interesting reading. I threw it away."
1,"Simpley put, hate speech!","Nothing but a ranting of a person trying to paint Islam as hatful. I can write the same one sided BS about Christianity and Judaism and any other religion. He has selected passages and has presented it as he wants to see it, just like terrorist that have high jacked Islam to promote their own ideology.This book is a waste of time, space and energy."
1,Don't waste your money,"The quality of this unit is the pits. The sound is close to okay for out in the garage where I have mine. The CD player did not last long and was quirky form the day I took it out of the box. I now use it to play MP3s off a memory card and have to admit this is a nice feature to begin with. At this point, if it wasn't for the MP3 capability, it would be in the trash."
2,FBI,"I thought this story was very good except for one little thing, and that would be how they kept jumping from different people to different jobs. I would recommend this story to anyone who is interested in New York, New York's FBI, or just the way New York's FBI handles themselves as agents. BALTIMORE I thought this story was very good as well. The reason why i thought this is because Baltimore was the first city to have a female on thier force. I thought it was great to see how men as well as women have the courage to stand-up and fight for others."
1,They are kidding right?,"I purchased this at WalMart.....waste of money. These people are professional dancers and if you have no dance experience you won't be able to do these excercise dance routines. Also they dance on a hard floor (not carpet) and the women are in HIGH heels. After a few days of attempting to follow these people, I put on 2 inch heels and followed a little bit better, but still got mixed up and couldn't follow, changes are too fast and like I said, no dance experience.....don't waste your money. Unless you want to spend most of your workout marching in place or stepping from one foot to the other. Definately not for the beginner or someone with two left feet."
2,"Walter Pidgeon, Action Star","A taut, fascinating adaptation of Geoffrey Household's prewar thriller ""Rogue Male,"" Pidgeon stars as a big-game hunter with the chance to take out Hitler on the eve of World War II. He is thwarted, but now is the subject of a man-hunt which takes him back to London, and danger around every corner. Low-budget and dark, Fritz Lang made the film quickly to raise his standing in the Hollywood community, and it succeeded. Lang went on to bigger projects in the US, and this film did quite well, released during 1941. Pidgeon is quite good as the hunter, and his scenes with Roddy McDowell, his son in ""How Green Was My Valley,"" resonate. Joan Bennett is lovely in what was her first major role, and George Sanders is the perfect Nazi villain. Well worth the time, and the documentary which accompanies the film sets it beautifully in its time period, and shows how important this film was to Lang and Lang's career."
2,A Fabulous Album,A fine album of late 1980's funk/dance music done gracfully by the diva Grace Jones.
1,Rip Off--vhs4less.,"Rip Off--vhs4less. Obviously a copy--blurry, bad sound, glitches on tape. Sold as ""nearly new"". Yep. It was nearly new and nearly an original, but not an original. Very disappointed and irritated. Won't ever buy from these folks again."
1,If you buy this you craped out!,"Don't waste your money on this book. Even as a primer on the game of craps it falls way short. Most of the information contained is in the free gaming brochures that the casinos hand out. The real rip here is that in the last chapter Allen is hustleing an expensive ""system"" that you have to order seperatly. Look for other books on craps that go into detail about money management and winning strategy"
1,Didn't give me much guidance,"I was really disappointed with this book. It was basically a psychology book masquerading as an advice book.I already have a very good idea why the toxic people around me behave as they do, and I do not think that it is my job to coddle them and condone their rude, selfish behavior. There is no excuse for them refusing to do something about their problems.What I wanted was tips on how to cope with them and minimize the damage to me, not tips on how to feel all sorry for them when I probably have much worse problems than they do. I spend a lot of money and put a lot of effort into being the best person I can be, and they could do the same if they wanted to.I really wanted my money back for this book. What a waste !"
2,Oh my Colors!,"Ver good book on color design. Has many useful examples as well as intersting ways to use them. Also good for beginners to introduce them to color without overwheling them. Would recommend to novice-intermediate designers, but also a good reference for some pros."
1,ALEGRIA,"BEWARE! FOR THOSE WHO ARE FANS OF CIRQUE DU SOLEIL, AS I AM, ALEGRIA WILL COME AS A MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. IT IS A FILM WITH A SILLY STORY SO INCONSEQUENTIAL, UNBELIEVABLE, AND NONSENSICAL THAT IT WILL APPEAL NEITHER TO ADULTS, CHILDREN, NOR THEIR PETS. THE CASTING IS ATROCIOUS: THE MAIN CHARACTERS ARE UNAPPEALING (EXCEPT FOR THE FEMALE LEAD)INCLUDING A MISCAST, HOPELESSLY OVERWEIGHT FRANK LANGELLA. THE FANTASTIC CIRQUE PERFORMERS ARE SHOWN IN EXTREMELY BRIEF EPISODES, SUGGESTING THAT THEY WERE MAINLY PICKUP SHOTS WHILE PERFORMING IN BERLIN AND CUT INTO THE BODY OF THE PRODUCTION FILMED IN AMSTERDAM. THE NON CIRQUE PERFORMERS, INCLUDING THE ALLEGED CLOWNS, HAVE NEITHER WIT, CHARM,NOR TALENT,ALL HALLMARKS OF CIRQUE DU SOLEIL. ALSO LACKING IS THE WONDERFUL MUSIC THAT HIGHLIGHTS ALL TRUE CIRQUE PERFORMANCES. FORGET IT!"
2,HVAC in Laymans terms!,"This book is excellent! I knew NOTHING about this industry until I decided to take a class. This book lays it all out in such a way that technical issues have been easy to understand.Also, the price for this book at my college was $115.00!! EVEN with shipping it was LESSS than $100.00 through Amazon and I got the book in 2 days!"
1,unpleasant,"What I don't understand is how any individual (or in this case, individuals) can turn her nose up at seemingly every facet of American society to which they are unfamiliar with, and then attempt to pass themselves off as having any proper ettiquette whatsoever. aren't proper manners a means to set others at ease, rather than a means to place oneself above anyone who might, on a very hot day, condescend to wear shorts?I find this book (and its authors) to be childish and ridiculous."
2,"A Masterpiece, Exciting, Challenging, and Extremely Poignant","The Hanging Garden Leads us all to wonder what it would be like to have a second oppurtunity. A chance to do it all over again, and the conciquences that come with that second chance. Brave and extremely challenging I recommemd this film to all with an open mind!"
2,Awesome CD,"I have to say that this CD and this artist are the best ever as far as modern music is concerned. Monica showed a lot of soul in songs like Inside, Right Here Waiting, and Angel of Mine. I like how her songs are each unique and completely different from one another. Definitely worth buying this CD."
2,Pretty special...,"I'm presently working my way through PA school, and this book has a ring to it I can't seem to keep out of my ears. Each new situation or patient I'm with brings back the words Selzer uses to present his stories. I'd strongly recommend it as a gift to those in MD or PA school--besides being outstanding writing, its fun to see the many ways medicine has changed, coupled with the countless ways it remains the same. Read especially ""A Pint of Blood""...no matter how many times I read it, it still has me laughing."
2,sounds better each play,"Unfortunately, a really good 70s album that never got released in the 70s. Reminiscent of Flash but with a female singer. Styles are all over the place- 7 songs, 7 styles, 7 different songs. Some arrangements will please Yes fans."
1,Avoid at all costs,This simply an awful movie. The script is paper thin and completely unbelievable. Nearly all the gags fall short and the characters are all generally unlikable. I can't think of one redeeming quality. This movie is an undoubtedly a huge waste of time.
2,Excellent,"I got a pink Klean Kanteen, and I love it! I've been using it for about 3 weeks now, but I do have concerns about a few small rusty spots that have appeared. Other than that, the water I drink out of it tastes great, and I haven't wasted any more plastic bottles! Its a very durable brand, I just think I may have gotten a faulty bottle. Very pleased."
2,Just what I wanted for my kids!,"Nice little toy music instruments. Kids love them! So, the product itself is really good.Unfortunately, this was intended for Christmas. While the packege got here in time, the contents were incomplete! One of the sticks was missing and the mallets were not like on the picture. I did not have time to send the package back and request a new one on time for Christmas. It seemd like it was a used product, none of the instruments were wrapped, they were just thrown into a box..."
2,Bosch Formula Classic vacuum cleaner long term review,"We've owned this Bosch Formula Classic vacuum cleaner for 7 years and it's still going strong, even with a Golden Retriever in the house. The dog hair is very difficult to get out of the vcarpet and oriental rugs, but this lightweight Bosch vacuum does a great job with it. We also have hardwood floors and tile bathroom floors and the Bosch cleans it all with the provided attachments. I like how light the cleaner is and how easy it is to move around. My only complaint is that I wish the hose was longer so that I could more easily vacuum the stairs. The Carpet head tends to get bogged down with hair, but it's easy to clean out and you can see just how much hair the vacuum picks up! I only wish Bosch still sold these in the US! It's easy to find bags and HEPA filters online and we buy them in 10 packs to save $. A great vacuum!!"
1,Where is the spirit?,"Like many readers, I loved Ross King's book on Brunelleschi's Dome and looked forward to this one. I was disappointed and did not finish ""The Judgment of Paris."" Crammed with needless details -- did we really need to know minute biographical data on the man who made the catalog for the 1863 salon? -- the book reads like one of its early chapter titles ""A Baffling Maze of Canvas."" Lost in the maze is the spirit of impressionism -- the bold, daring, and devoutly Bohemian characters who risked all for art. Manet, Monet and the rest come across here as dry, calculating tacticians. Their fierce devotion to art, their love of light, their passion for life and women and absinthe are drowned in the details of what bureaucrat or politician said what to whom and when."
2,This book made me laugh!,"As a cust service rep, I could relate to the stories of Mike Daisey. I mentioned a few times to my husband that I knew exactly what Mike was talking about.This was a good book and a fast read!"
2,Works fine,This works just fine for our old large slider. The fabric is kind of thin but if it holds up that doesn't matter.
1,"Cute pandas, but poor paper quality","The pandas featured in this 2006 calendar are really cute ane one glance makes you fall in love instantly with them.Unfortunately, the paper this calendar (distributed by Browntrout Publishers) is rather poor quality. Each sheet is thin and tears easily. Worse, after hanging on my cubicle wall for 2 weeks, the paper is already turning yellowish.If you want a 2006 wall calendar featuring pandas, considering the one distributed by Petprints, also available on Amazon, just search for ISBN/ASIN 1843028530. The pandas are equally cute, and the paper quality is better.Go panda, go!"
1,Sun Zapper is too small to do any zapping.,"The sun zapper is too narrow to be of any help. When attached to the visor appropriately, it is too high to be of help unless you are very tall. I am average height and it doesn't block the sun at all unless its nearly noon."
1,Gave up after first 5 minutes,"This product works fine for the very first 5 minutes, and then black smoke coming out of the motor compartment vent. After that, it quits, and nothing happens when you press the trigger. I saw other customers having the same encounter with this product. Seems like it's got a quality control problem at the factory."
1,The Price is wrong...,My local kroger is selling this item at $3.88 per bottle (if you use your reward card - which is free to anyone who wants it) - do the math. The amazon price is a rip off.
2,a bit of a departure,"A lot of people are not pleased with the direction the Blood Brothers took on this one. I guess they ""sold out"" or whatever. Having Ross Robinson produce their record could not have helped. Also there is more melody on this one, more actual singing instead of just yelling. That makes their music less angular, for better or worse. My opinion is that the tweaking of the formula worked, and I enjoy Burn Piano Island, Burn more than their previous records. The one dude still mutters and shouts, the other still squeaks and drawls, sounding like the singer of Tesla on uppers with his crotch pinched. The sound is crystal clear. Despite being the producer of bands so horrible I will not name them here, Robinson did nothing to hinder the music.One more thing: the cover art totally smokes. Whoever did it deserves a pat on the back."
2,nice price but great product,"its nonstick so eazy to clean.heats up evenly and fast.great product,i am very much satisfied,i use it daily.its nice quality.handles very well made for nice grip,dont get hot too.i recomend it product highly."
1,Nikon 995 [stinks],Spent nearly [item price] when all was said and done. The camera is fun. The software [is bad] and renders the camera of little value. Nikon supports [is] worse than their software. Virtually impossible to get any of my computers to recognize the memory cards so I can transfer the images to my hard drive. I have spent hours and hours and hours trying to get this worked out. Buy something else!!! I seriously regret this purchase.
2,Wow!,I don't see how anyone could not like this book! The author does a great job explaining the complex history of this ancient Goddess. I found some good information here that I hadn't encountered before. I think this book is excellent!
1,Very strong scent!,"I tried several times to use this lotion, but the scent is so strong, it is overwhelming. Maybe it's just me, but this is not the patchouli I remember from hippie times. I could not wash the smell off my hands - ended up just throwing it away. I really did want to like this! :("
1,be careful when you buy this,Be sure you are purchasing the correct product. Supplier IDigToys will only accept returns within 14 days of purchase.
1,Uncomfortable,"My husband bought this snoogle to help me sleep because it was hard for me to sleep on my side (I used to sleep on my back). The pillow is very uncomfortable, you can't move using it. If you are a person who sleeps in one position all night long then you might like it. I hate this pillow, I used it only for couple of hours because I couldn't bear it."
2,Grandson loved it.,"Mom, of course, didn't care for the mess but, hey, she was warned ahead of time and an old shower curtain worked well to catch extraneous particles."
1,awful,"i can't believe people like this book.it's realy awful.and i bought this book when there was no new star wars books out and i was starving for something new from star wars.i would keep reading the old brian dalye or alan dean foster books.but i guess being spoiled by those writers reading zahn's book coulnd only be a dissapointment.and i really wanted to like this book.he just copies too much from the other writers instead of making something new.i mean an old jedi master.hey people use your brain trying to make another obi-wan character,sheesh!."
2,"Are you fascinated by history, but tend to struggle when reading ""historical books?""","Books written by Michael and Jeff Shaara just might offer the best chance to bring history alive for you!It must be noted (as the authors do) that these books are in fact novels. This distinguishes them from pure history books in that the authors have taken some literary license in an attempt to get inside the thoughts and minds of the historic characters that are portrayed in their books. Although the plot is based on historical fact, both Michael and Jeff Shaara attempt to enter the consciences of the Great Founders of our Country to bring them alive in the minds of their readers. And, much to my enjoyment, I found myself flying through these books about history the way I would a Nelson DeMille or Robert Ludlum novel!"
1,pretty bad,"I couldn't sit through this movie with my kids. They thought it was okay, but prefer Sonic X. These are grainy and poorly written. I can usually sit through about anything, but I only lasted 10 minutes on this one. I would recommend the Sonic X movies as they are better quality, more exciting and overall easier to watch."
1,"Awful, dreadful and nearly unwatchable...","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie too ! A few fast cars and some of the other mindless trappings that usually accompany this type of action film can make for a cool diversion. Unfortunately, the story line is absurd and the dialogue is unintentionally laughable. As for the action scenes, the 1/4 mile drag races last more than a minute which about the time it would take a fast runner to complete the distance. This movie disappoints across the board..."
2,One thing Missing,"If there is one thing that is missing from the third release from the Detroit born rapper Xzibit it is a song that speaks of his upbringing. All classic hip-hop albums have that one song that makes you really hear where the artist is coming from. The album is great even without this type of song. As always, Dre brings his immense talent to the mixing boards and Eminem even gets behind the scenes to do a track that he appears on with the X to the Z."
2,fun suspenders,"I bought these suspenders for my husband who has taken up woodworking. They're a great design with sturdy elastic straps. One of the clips on the pair we got didn't clasp correctly so I sent them back. I had also purchased another pair of suspenders. My husband only wanted one pair, so I didn't exchange these, I just sent them back. The company was wonderful to work with. I had no problem getting a refund and they did everything in their power to make things right. If it hadn't been for the one little problem, I would have kept this pair. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from this company again in the future."
2,Thought Provoking,"Being an English major I've had my share of anthologies. The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism stands out to me because it offers direct access to the writers and their essays rather than filtered, explained, and dissected discussions of them. It allows for the opportunity to explore what the author had to say in their own voice. Unfortunately that means some selections are more difficult to read than others. The trade-off is knowing that what you are reading is the source of the idea rather than a reflection of it. While I bought this book as a class requirement, reading it (and I am nowhere near done) has offered me new perspectives to not only view literature, but the world in general. That is probably the best thing I can say about this book. The worst? It's not a light read -- literally! Having to tote this brick around campus for a semester was not a pleasant experience regardless of how interesting the essays are."
2,hot indeed,This book is good. Once it's over there's an unexpected twist and then surprise another twist and just when you think it's done one more is thrown out there. White Hot is definitely hot. Way to go Sandra Brown I'm enjoying your work.
2,Uncle Ted,"This cd rocks, but I find Free for All his best cd, but everyone who likes good ol Uncle Ted should own it. After Free for All and Great White Buffalo live version Uncle Ted losses his edge."
2,Page Turner,"This is the second book continuing Tim Rackley's adventures after his involvement with the vigilantes who double crossed him and cost him his career with the US Marshal's office. This time he gets involved with a cult based outside of Los Angeles. I could not put this book down. I was happy that Rack could continue to heal after his daughter's murder by putting his energies into rescuing poor little Leah, who could not leave the cult on her own. Great book! I am now reading The Troubleshooter, which is the third book in the series and just as much a page turner as the first two books. I love Gregg Hurwitz books. Great, fast and exciting reads!"
1,Non repairable junk,My Polaroid unit lasted about 7 months. Then the picture just went out. The warranty was for six months. I couldn't get anyone to fix it so it went in the trash.
1,Not good at all,"Bought one last year and was able to use for only 2 weeks. Now it plays (both ordinary cd audio and mp3's) sometimes but most of the time it will not recognize the cd at all. The player did not undergo any rough handling or anything. If all the reviews about how good this product is true, then I guess I'm just unlucky."
2,Great Tool,I use ACAD 200 daily. My copy of this book is quite dog eared and probably needs to be replaced. I am almost constantly thinking of ways that I could get my ACAD 2000 program to work better with me. This book is extremely helpful for me to do that. I have found this book to be laid out well and has a VERY extensive index so that I can find out how to do what I want to do. I recommend very strongly that anyone that uses ACAD 2000 on a regular basis to have this book in their library and within reach.
2,dog show spoof,"very, very funny video about the people who chose to show American Kennel Club dogs in dog shows. it nails many of the different types down to a tee and takes it over the top a bit.overall, it was really a great, entertaining video."
1,Don't Bother With This...,"...This is the worst book on LRRP/LRPs I have read, and I have read a few. I would recommend anything by Rey Martinez, Gary Linderer, et al. instead of this book.Dimestore LiamDetroit"
2,"Haven't Read Much of It, but I'm already Buying It!","I couldn't give it 5 stars simply becuase I haven't yet finished reading it. I borrowed this book from the library and couldn't finish it in the lending period (it's big!), so I'm now online buying the book.What I've read is extrememly well-written and interesting, not of a textbook style at all. It explains Tibetan philosophy in a very accessible way.I reccommend it for anyone interested in Tibet or Buddhism."
1,You call this good?????,"This book was very long, and very slow. I am not one to abandon a book, but doing so to this one was very tempting. So much garbage about nothing. I agree with the reader who said BLAH BLAH BLAH. Maybe if it was shorter it may have been a little easier to swallow. The part about Domenico's book I had to skip altogether because it was bogus. I have read many books in my life and this one does not get a rave review from me. Wally Lamb should have stuck to the likes of ""She's Come Undone."" That was a great book, so good, it took less than 2 days to read. Take my advice, skip this book unless an ""Oprah"" atmosphere fascinates you."
2,Smooth skin...,"This polishing towel is great. There hard to find outside of the internet I've found over the last few years. My friend whose from Hawaii introduced me to polishing towels and there great. Increases the overall health and appearance of your skin. I have follicle bumps on my forearm, and the towel clears that right up. Worth trying...you'll be hooked! Don't use daily if you have dry or sensitive skin, because it can dry out your skin. Use a good moisturizer with the towel is my only recommendation."
1,The man is a kook,"It's rare for new religions to be created out of whole cloth, but it's a goal that JS Spong seems to be striving towards. For centuries, the two central tenants of Christianity have been that Christ was God and that Christ died for sin. Spong believes neither of these, and thus his ""New Christianity"" is completely void of anything that Christianity has been for 2000 years. As a result, Spong's view is decidedly new-age and more resembing pop-psychology than a real delving into hard questions about the Christian faith."
2,What will they think of next?,"I saw these in a grocery store and picked them up on a whim. I must say, it's the best choice I ever made. I make my own yogurt with fruit and these save me quite a bit of time, hassle, and mess. If scooping kiwis, it's better to cut the fruit lengthwise, that way you'll have an easier time of getting past the stem. For mangoes, get one of those OXO mango splitters and use this to take the meat from the skin (as well as the seed). Even though, it is made of plastic, it is 'sharp' enough to get through any fruit with minimal effort. I havent used it on potatoes yet, but I have a strong confidence that it will work out fine.The scoop allows you to get very close to the skin without breaking through. In just 4 uses, I have already figured out how to scoop to the point where there is no meat left on the skin whatsoever.You wont go wrong with this purchase. You'll even smile as you use it."
1,As good as a Magic 8 Ball,"Anyone with at least a little experience in tarot knows that though the cards and positions themselves have suggested meanings you can not deduce one's subjective experience to a single sentence. Interpreting tarot is like interpreting dreams, something which can not be done without some basic knowledge of the internal situation. The beginning of the book is useful but everything else should be taken with a grain of salt."
2,wall ironing board,"This ironing board is great if you are trying to save space. It folds up on the wall. When folded down to use, it works like a regular ironing board. It is strong and durable."
1,Didn't work when plugged in!,"This was my 2nd CHI. I bought the first one on Amazon and had it for about a year. Then out of no where it wouldn't turn on. I ordered another, used it once, and then it wouldn't turn on. I will never buy a CHI again."
1,reasonable/not working,"not happy,use all the time and this year its not working so good,hanged to another brand.good price but not happy with product nymore"
2,GREAT REFERENCE BOOK! GLAD I HAD IT!,I had a pediatrician that wasn't much help on the breastfeeding issue. I didn't know many people who had breastfed and I picked up this book at the store. It was absolutely invaluable to me and I referenced it many times. I now have a healthy 1 year old daughter and I attribute that robust health to giving her the right start in life. I was able to continue nursing her right up to her 1st birthday and I don't think I could have done it without this book.
2,Not Your Average Artist,"Aight, this guy, Nelly, he isn't like every other rapper, his lyrics are full of murder, rape, guns or gang related crimes. He is more concerned about havin a good time with his boyz and ladies, and doesn't bother singing about how if you look at you wrong he's gonna kill you and your family. I mean the violent lyrics don't bother me it's just a nice change."
2,BEST VAMPIRE MOVIE YET!,"THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD.THERE'S BLOOD,GOR,AND ECT.THIS MOVIE SHOWS A BETTER WAY OF VAMPIRES.FOR EXAMPLE,IN OTHER VAMPIRE MOVIES IT'S THE SAME YOU BITE THE NECK AND YOU TURN BUT IN THIS MOVIE YOU HAVE A CHOICE.SO WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO SAY IS THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT THAN ALL THE OTHERS OUT THERE.BUY THIS MOVIE NOW.TRUE CLASSIC."
2,nicely written classic,"I read this book when I was in my teens, many many years ago. Discussing older books read with a friend this book came to mind. I couldn't remember who it was written by until doing my search on here. I bought 2 of these books, one for my self and one for a friend. But by 2 different sellers. However, the books were in excellent condition, the price was outstanding. Sellers were very prompt in delivery product to me, and I'm overall satisfied with my purchases. Thank you very very much."
2,I snore just fine now.,"I have purchased both the light weight and comfort series of this pad in regular size. For the extra 6 ounces of weight, this comfort series is really nice and my ground tent saver. It's only partially self inflating, expect to add a few puffs for ultimate lay. A bit thicker than the light weight version and those bumps on the bottom keep it in place all night long. After just a few nights out under the stars I can honestly say this one is for me. Stuff sack and patch kit included, which another top brand at 3 times the cost makes you buy separately. Im sold on this item and put the other brand up for sale. I bought the light version for hammock camping, but found this to work just as good there too as a cold barrier, I don't count ounces at this point. As long as the pricing stays down, this will be hard to beat."
1,Why Did I Even Finsh Watching,"The previews for this movie looked good and made me think it was going to be all about Brad Pitt and his people going around killing nazi's. Nope, all this movie really is about is a girl who's family was killed by a nazi leader when she was younger then she grows up to own a movie theater. The nazi's are in town and want to watch a a nazi movie at her theater. The girl then plans to trap all the nazi's in the theater and kill them by blowing up the theater. This movie really has nothing to do with the Inglourious Basterds and they are rarely even needed for the movie. Bottom line save your time and go save the planet or something because after you waste about 2 1/2 hrs. of this bull you'd wish you had."
2,Dark and Delightful,"O.K., so here's the plan. Start with Mieville's ""Un Lun Dun"". Then move on to Gaiman's ""Neverwhere"". Then advance to Simon R. Green's Nightside books, (say, ""Something From the Nightside"").That way you can have a lot of fun with how cleverly Mieville lays his alternate London right over the top of ""real"" London. Enjoy the zest and unruly imagination of a deeply original writer.Then compare with the almost stately, restrained elegance of Gaiman's approach to alternate-London. Gaiman's imagination is just boundless, and every page is infused with his great sense of place, and his deft touch. Sure the book is ""dark"", but only in a thrilling sense, not the world weary, or ironic, or hopeless style of many current writers.For a change-up go to the Nightside of London, with the noirish, tongue-in-cheek, and much more fantastical Green.Really, what a trifecta."
1,Picture deceiving and not for Adults more for a CHILD.,I bought this for my wife as a separate package deal with the matching earrings. But when they arrived the necklace was to SMALL as for a child. It will not look good on an adult IMHO. Sent back to Amazon and got full credit.Thanks Amazon dot com.
2,Help for bad feet.,"I have been dealing with severe plantar faciitis for 2 years. It is off and on, but mostly on. I have had cortisone shots in my heels, (horrible) and I have worn the stretch boots at night, taken the naproxen, you name it. I have spent hundreds, maybe thousands in the past trying to find shoes that don't kill my feet. The price tag on one pair was $250. OUTRAGEOUS. But, I am happy to say the one shoe that helps the most is a stable shoe with a good arch. The addicition 9 allowed me to start my exercise regime again. I have given up running, but thanks to this shoe I can again walk several miles at a time without heel pain. These shoes are not sold as a cure for PF, but I think they could be! Thanks Brooks for making a quality shoe that I can afford."
1,A sophisticated piece of recompilation.,"First off, if you wonder in what language that song is sang that sounds like redemption song? Douala!!!! Yes that is the language and little by little and bit by bit and indeed little bit by little bit, this central african language from Cameroon, first appeared in Michael Jackson's Thriller in the 80's. It is elbowing its way thru the boulevards of modern jazz , with pioneers like Richard Bona, the African Bazz jazz erudite.Well, this album is well crafted , in every aspect.Yes true Bob purists mAy find that this album lacks that ginger taste from Kingston!! Well, I believe that the flavors had just been substituted with all kinds of other fLavors from around the world, making this twist even SPICIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!M""BOLO!!!!!!!!!(BYE)"
2,This is one heck of a CD,This is an exceptional CD all song's worth listening to some a little different but still worth it and I recommend this to anyone that listen's to this type of music
1,F&%##!@# Shoe Rack,"This shoe rack is a piece of junk. After assembling it and putting only 10 pairs of shoes on the bottom shelves it already started to fall apart. The bars did not fit into the side brackets and continually popped out. We duct-taped the ends and tied it together with strings, but it still fell apart. Do not buy this item. Find something else. This is TERRIBLE. Plus, since we duct-taped it they won't take returns. Booo."
1,incredibly bad,"I am in a quandry. I don't know which is worse - the bad transfer from a poor film or the so-called music. Both suck. The transfer is from a bad copy of a bad quality film. The music is so insipid I can barely call it music. The people who rated this more than 2 stars must have been smoking, shooting, dropping, or snorting something illegal. Or jerks who have no taste whatsoever. This is one for the trash bin, pure and simple. Do NOT waste your time or taste."
1,Hard to take seriously,"I wanted to like this book and I do have a genuine interest in the supposed subject of the book, the battle of Tobruk. The author doesn't get there until nearly halfway through the book after some very wide-ranging set-up. The background info on some of the Australian soldiers in the story is understandable. Much of the rest I found to be tedious as someone who is fairly well-read. Perhaps others not so familiar with the broader history of the Second World War will find this aspect of the book more interesting. What bothered me the most was the author's incessant use of slang and even tasteless language. Some of this is acceptable when encountered in a memoir but the author here seems to be trying to spice up the book and it doesn't work for me. This book turned out to be one of the rare books I failed to finish to the end."
1,Very disappointing,"I was looking forward to a verbal journey. A talk with musicians and poets, historians and purveyors of folklore. And I got a little of that. Very little.This is a very short volume, and more than I'd like is made up of excerpts of past books. This should be a little spice for the stew, not a major ingredient.In the whole, it reads as a dry (and there is the main problem, it is dry) history lesson.Again it is short. It would have worked as well as a long magazine article."
1,Should have read reviews before I bought,"If you are considering buying this album because you like the song ""One thing"" - don't! The other songs on this album are very hard rock/metal. ""One thing"" does not represent the type of music this band plays at all. If you like hard rock/metal (which I do) you may enjoy this album. I personally find the songs monotinous. They all sound the same to me (with the exception of ""One thing"", of course.)"
1,Did not work after unpacking,"My review is simple. The light doesn't work. I unpacked the light, installed the batteries and the left light didn't work. I noticed that both the light and the switch were flimsy so I moved them a little and it began working. But then I tried a few more times and the left light stopped working again. When it worked, its light flickers. The right light also flickers.I find this product flimsy and constructed with low quality materials and poorly assembled."
2,SUPERB AS USUAL!,"It's incredible to think that ABC want to axe this show. It is funny and thought provoking. Ok so some people who aren't quite up there in the brightness stakes might find it hard at time to comprehend but this series is just as good as the rest. Spader is his usual remarkable complicated self and Denny, well, it's been a long time since television writers and producers have managed to create such a character as Denny Crane. ABC should take another look at ceasing what is delightfully referred to in one of the US papers as ""both lighthearted and funny but with wit and truth that could burn through a freezer'! Excellent again. If it aint broke, don't fix it! Please guys don't end this fabulous show."
1,Just Terrible!!!!,"First of all, i bought this driver for $24.99 and it sucked sinced the day i bought it. well, the first one I purchased got a dent in the back of the club. So, I exchanged it and got another one. It held up for three months and the performance was good but I'm a rookie golfer anyway! I took it out for a short 9-holes and the damn club head broke off completely on the first hole!! That was terrible, but you get what you pay for and i would not reccomend this club to anyone!!"
1,Poor written book,This book is definitely not for a student to read. A lot of sentences are very difficult to understand. I have to read a few times to try to understand. Also this book lack of examples. I don't understand why we have to choose to use this book as a textbook.
2,Depicted like real-life,"I assumed this would just be another movie...but I was surprised at the twists and turns in the movie's plot. I enjoyed this, although I didn't realize the mom was the mom until later in the movie since her acting was more like a foster parent or aunt. The dad seemed a little odd in his acting as well, but Ariel was great. The hospital scenes were a little ""low budget"" especially the scene with the tube in Ariel's mouth. Overall, I do think the topic was great and the entire movie was VERY REALISTIC."
1,Good Golly Miss Mollie.,"I always thought I knew what the F-word meant until I saw this movie. It now has the meaning of a truly wasted 3 hours, maybe even more since I had to drive there and back. Both actors and writers have a great deal of talent, it was just wasted on the F-word movie."
1,Horrible experience with Amazone wireless,"Dont even go there, go immediately to the provider to get the real deal.device provided was used-not new. Amazon would fool you with free bluetooth headset that is not working properly and needs a new battery; said in another way, it seems that the bluetooth headset is been there in Amazon stores for a long time-outdated- and therefore, battery does not hold charge, and when I asked for a replacement, a similar deffictive device was sent.So, dont go there. go to the cell service provider."
2,great gift for all your female friends,"I love this book. The recipes are great! I have given to many friends. It's a wonderful hostess gift, birthday gift, or holiday gift, no size guessing involved. Everyone whom I gave it to has given it rave reviews and it's a book they actually use! The recipes are simple and quick. You know you've picked a winner when the person calls and asks if you tried a particular recipe yet because they have and love it. Also great for the single young lady with little cooking experience."
2,Cervical Traction Device--great,"This helps give me relief from neck pain. It's great. It may not be recommended to do so but I took off the spring and just use the cradle for a nice, deep stretch."
2,Perfect for the younger fan!,"My 7 1/2 yr. old granddaughter loves the music & dancing on Glee, but is too young for the mature themes. This will be an excellent alternative! THANKS Fox!!"
1,dig a hole.,This is bad on nearly every level. Most of the songs are are without accompanyment so the fact that they are off key is quite apparent. I am sure there are good recordings of these songs however this is not one of them.
1,Book was much better!!!,This would have been better off not being made into a movie. Too many details left out that made the story.
1,Clapton masterpices,I'm a big fan of Eric Clapton and his music dating from the Yardbirds forward. He's done a tremendous body of work. Unfortunately you won't find much here worth buying. The overall content and quality are pretty poor. Rather than masterpieces this more like the stuff left (for good reason) out of many other DVD's covering his work.
2,A very good video Biography of Joni,"At the time of writing this, I am just cutting the surface of Joni's music. This Biography has deepened my understanding of Joni. Interesting to note how she adapts to a new period and always re-invents herself. She has never gone after pop music but stayed personal in her approach. I especially enjoyed her speaking of her guitar playing and she referred to her strange guitar tunings as a ""Chords or Inquiry"". There is much to absorb here, and I've found myself watching it about 3 times up to now. It is a good launching point if you are preparing to experience Joni's music and there are many performance bits from various periods."
